# Sensor Calibration Techniques

**Sensor Calibration** is the process of experimentally determining and correcting the parameters of a sensor's model to improve its accuracy and reliability. This involves relating the sensor's output readings to the true physical quantities being measured and/or determining the geometric relationship (position and orientation) between sensors or between a sensor and the robot's frame of reference.

## Purpose of Calibration

Calibration is crucial in robotics because sensors rarely behave exactly according to their ideal theoretical models due to:

* Manufacturing tolerances and imperfections.
* Mounting inaccuracies when installed on a robot.
* Environmental factors (e.g., temperature effects on electronics).
* Sensor aging or drift over time.

By identifying and compensating for these systematic errors, calibration achieves:

* **Improved Accuracy:** Reduces bias and scale factor errors, leading to more accurate measurements.
* **Data Consistency:** Ensures data from multiple sensors can be reliably combined ([[Sensor_Fusion]]).
* **Metric Reconstruction:** Enables accurate spatial measurements and mapping from sensors like [[Camera_Systems|cameras]] and [[LIDAR]].
* **Reliable Control:** Provides accurate feedback for control loops (e.g., visual servoing, force control).
* **Model Accuracy:** Refines the internal models (kinematic, dynamic) used by the robot system.

## Types of Calibration

Sensor calibration generally falls into two main categories:

1.  **[[Intrinsic Calibration]]:** Focuses on determining the internal parameters of a single sensor that define the mapping between the physical input and the sensor's output. This corrects for errors inherent to the sensor itself.
    * **Examples:**
        * **Camera:** Focal length, principal point (image center), lens distortion coefficients (radial, tangential).
        * **[[IMU_Sensors|IMU]]:** [[Accelerometer]] and [[Gyroscope]] bias offsets, scale factor errors, axis non-orthogonalities (misalignments), noise parameters (e.g., random walk, bias instability via Allan variance).
        * **Range Sensor (LIDAR, Sonar):** Range offset (bias), scale factor error.
2.  **[[Extrinsic Calibration]]:** Focuses on determining the relative spatial relationship (6 DoF pose: position and orientation, often represented by a [[Homogeneous Transformation Matrix]]) between the coordinate frames of:
    * **Multiple Sensors:** E.g., the transform between a [[Camera_Systems|camera]] and an [[IMU_Sensors|IMU]], a camera and a [[LIDAR]], or the baseline transform between cameras in a [[Stereo Vision|stereo rig]]. This is essential for [[Sensor_Fusion]].
    * **Sensor and Robot Frame:** E.g., the transform between a camera mounted on a robot's [[End-Effector]] and the end-effector frame ([[Hand-Eye Calibration]]), or the pose of a fixed sensor (like a navigation camera or LIDAR) relative to the robot's base frame.

A related concept, particularly for manipulators, is:

* **Kinematic Calibration:** Focuses on identifying the *robot's* actual geometric parameters (e.g., link lengths, joint offsets, twists, using conventions like [[Denavit-Hartenberg Convention]]) rather than sensor parameters. This improves the accuracy of the robot's [[Forward_Kinematics]] and [[Inverse_Kinematics]] models by compensating for deviations from the nominal design due to manufacturing tolerances and assembly errors.

## Common Calibration Techniques

The specific technique depends heavily on the sensor type and the parameters being calibrated. Most methods involve collecting data under specific conditions and using optimization to fit a model to the data.

* **[[Camera_Systems|Camera Calibration]]:**
    * **Method:** Typically uses a known calibration target (e.g., planar checkerboard, grid of circles). The target is imaged from multiple unknown viewpoints. Feature points (e.g., checkerboard corners) are detected accurately in each image.
    * **Parameters Estimated:** Simultaneously estimates intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) and extrinsic parameters (pose of the camera relative to the target for each view).
    * **Algorithm:** Often based on minimizing the reprojection error (the difference between observed feature locations and locations predicted by the current model parameters) using nonlinear [[Least Squares Estimation|least-squares optimization]]. Zhang's method is a popular technique.

* **[[IMU_Sensors|IMU Calibration]]:**
    * **Method:** Often involves placing the IMU stationary in multiple known orientations relative to gravity. Accelerometer readings in static poses measure the gravity vector projection, allowing estimation of biases and scale factors. Gyro calibration often involves precisely controlled rotations at known rates. Magnetometer calibration requires rotating the sensor in a magnetically clean environment to map distortions.
    * **Parameters Estimated:** Biases, scale factors, axis misalignments for accelerometers and gyros. Noise parameters (random walk, bias instability) are characterized using Allan variance analysis on data collected over long static periods. Magnetometer calibration determines soft-iron and hard-iron distortion parameters.

* **[[LIDAR]] Calibration:**
    * **Intrinsic:** Often involves measuring distances to planar targets placed at known ranges to estimate range offset and scale factor.
    * **Extrinsic:** Requires finding correspondences between LiDAR measurements and either a known calibration target or features observed by another calibrated sensor (e.g., camera, another LiDAR). Optimization minimizes the discrepancy between the measurements from different sensors or between measurements and the target model to find the relative 6-DoF transformation.

* **Multi-Sensor Extrinsic Calibration (General):**
    * **Method:** Needs overlapping fields of view or a calibration target visible to all sensors being calibrated. Data is collected simultaneously from all sensors while either the robot moves or the target moves.
    * **Parameters Estimated:** The rigid body transformation (rotation matrix and translation vector) between each pair of sensor coordinate frames.
    * **Algorithm:** Optimization minimizes a cost function based on the consistency of observations across sensors (e.g., minimizing distance between corresponding 3D points measured by different sensors, or minimizing reprojection errors onto camera images).

* **Hand-Eye Calibration:**
    * **Method:** Solves the matrix equation $AX=XB$ or $AX=ZB$. $A$ represents the motion of the robot end-effector (measured via [[Forward_Kinematics]]), $B$ represents the motion of the calibration target relative to the sensor (measured by the sensor), and $X$ is the unknown transformation from the end-effector frame to the sensor frame (or $Z$ is the transform from the base to the target). Requires a sequence of robot movements while observing a static target, or observing a target attached to the end-effector from a static sensor.
    * **Parameters Estimated:** The 6-DoF pose $X$ (or $Z$).

* **Kinematic Calibration (Manipulators):**
    * **Method:** Requires an external, high-accuracy 3D measurement system (e.g., laser tracker, Coordinate Measuring Machine - CMM, calibrated camera system) to measure the actual end-effector pose for various joint configurations $\mathbf{q}$.
    * **Parameters Estimated:** Corrections $\Delta \phi$ to the nominal kinematic parameters $\phi$ (e.g., DH parameters).
    * **Algorithm:** Nonlinear least squares minimizes the difference between the measured end-effector poses and the poses predicted by the kinematic model $f(\mathbf{q}, \phi)$. The identification Jacobian relates parameter errors to pose errors.

## General Calibration Process

Most calibration procedures involve these steps:
1.  **Model Selection:** Choose a mathematical model relating the physical world to the sensor readings, including the parameters to be calibrated.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Collect sensor data under specific, controlled conditions (e.g., viewing a known target, performing specific motions, holding static poses).
3.  **Parameter Estimation:** Use the collected data and the model to estimate the optimal parameter values, typically by minimizing the error between model predictions and actual measurements using optimization techniques (e.g., least squares).
4.  **Validation:** Assess the quality of the calibration by evaluating the residual errors or testing the sensor's performance with the calibrated parameters.

Calibration can be performed **offline** (e.g., in a lab before deployment) or **online** (during operation, sometimes called self-calibration). Online methods are often less comprehensive but can track time-varying parameters like biases. Accurate sensor calibration is fundamental for achieving high performance in robotic systems that rely on sensor feedback.
