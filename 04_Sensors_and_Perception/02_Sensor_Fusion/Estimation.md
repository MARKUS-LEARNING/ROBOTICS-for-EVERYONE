# Estimation

**Estimation** in robotics involves the use of algorithms and techniques to approximate or predict unknown quantities, such as positions, velocities, or other parameters, based on available data. It is a critical component in robotic systems, enabling tasks like localization, navigation, and control. Estimation techniques are essential for dealing with uncertainties and noise in sensor data, allowing robots to make informed decisions and operate effectively in dynamic environments.

## Key Components of Estimation

1. **Sensor Data**: The raw data collected from sensors, which is often noisy and incomplete. Estimation techniques process this data to extract meaningful information.

2. **Models**: Mathematical representations of the system or environment, used to predict how the system behaves over time.

3. **Algorithms**: Computational methods used to process sensor data and update estimates based on new information.

4. **Uncertainty**: The inherent variability and noise in sensor data and models, which estimation techniques aim to manage and reduce.

## Mathematical Representations

### Kalman Filter

The Kalman Filter is a widely used estimation technique for linear systems. It provides estimates of a system's state by predicting the state and updating it based on sensor measurements:

1. **Prediction Step**:

$$
x_{k|k-1} = F x_{k-1|k-1} + B u_k
$$
$$
P_{k|k-1} = F P_{k-1|k-1} F^T + Q
$$

3. **Update Step**:

$$
K_k = P_{k|k-1} H^T (H P_{k|k-1} H^T + R)^{-1}
$$
$$
x_{k|k} = x_{k|k-1} + K_k (z_k - H x_{k|k-1})
$$
$$
P_{k|k} = (I - K_k H) P_{k|k-1}
$$

where $x$ is the state estimate, $P$ is the estimate covariance, $F$ is the state transition model, $B$ is the control input model, $u_k$ is the control input, $Q$ is the process noise covariance, $H$ is the observation model, $R$ is the measurement noise covariance, $K_k$ is the Kalman gain, and $z_k$ is the measurement.

### Particle Filter

The Particle Filter is a non-parametric estimation technique suitable for non-linear systems. It represents the probability distribution of the state using a set of particles:

1. **Prediction Step**:

$$
x_k^{(i)} \sim p(x_k | x_{k-1}^{(i)}, u_k)
$$

3. **Update Step**:

$$
w_k^{(i)} = p(z_k | x_k^{(i)})
$$
$$
w_k^{(i)} = \frac{w_k^{(i)}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} w_k^{(j)}}
$$

where $x_k^{(i)}$ is the state of the $i$-th particle, $w_k^{(i)}$ is the weight of the $i$-th particle, $p(x_k | x_{k-1}^{(i)}, u_k)$ is the state transition probability, and $p(z_k | x_k^{(i)})$ is the measurement likelihood.

### Bayesian Estimation

Bayesian estimation provides a probabilistic framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. The posterior distribution is computed using Bayes' theorem:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

where $P(A|B)$ is the posterior probability, $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, $P(A)$ is the prior probability, and $P(B)$ is the marginal likelihood.

## Applications of Estimation

Estimation techniques are used in various robotic applications:

- **Localization**: Determining the robot's position and orientation within the environment.
- **Navigation**: Planning and executing paths while accounting for uncertainties in the environment.
- **Control Systems**: Using estimates of the system state to control the robot's actions.
- **Parameter Estimation**: Estimating unknown parameters in models or systems.
