# Camera Systems

Camera systems are among the most powerful and versatile sensors used in robotics. They function as passive, exteroceptive sensors, capturing electromagnetic radiation (typically visible light, but also infrared or ultraviolet) reflected or emitted by the environment to produce images. These images provide rich, high-bandwidth data that can be processed using [[Computer Vision]] techniques to enable a wide range of robotic capabilities, from object recognition and manipulation to navigation and human-robot interaction.

## Image Formation and Sensor Technology

### Image Formation

Most cameras used in robotics can be approximated by the **pinhole camera model**. Light rays from a 3D point $(X, Y, Z)$ in the camera's coordinate frame pass through a single point (the optical center or pinhole) and project onto an image plane located at a focal distance $f$. The image coordinates $(x, y)$ are related to the 3D coordinates by perspective projection:
$$x = f \frac{X}{Z}$$
$$y = f \frac{Y}{Z}$$
Real cameras use lenses instead of pinholes to gather more light, introducing parameters like aperture and potential distortions (e.g., radial distortion) that need to be accounted for via [[Sensor_Calibration_Techniques|camera calibration]]. Pixel coordinates $(u, v)$ in the final digital image are related to image coordinates $(x, y)$ by scaling factors and the principal point location (image center).

### Sensor Technology

Modern digital cameras primarily use one of two sensor technologies to convert photons into electrical signals:

* **CCD (Charge-Coupled Device):** Mature technology where light hitting a pixel generates charge stored in a capacitor. During readout, charge is shifted sequentially row-by-row and column-by-column to an amplifier.
    * *Pros:* High sensitivity, excellent image quality (low noise), good dynamic range.
    * *Cons:* More complex manufacturing, higher power consumption, slower readout speeds, prone to "blooming" (charge spilling to adjacent pixels under intense light).
* **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor):** Technology where each pixel has its own photodiode, amplifier, and readout circuitry. Readout can be done directly per pixel or row.
    * *Pros:* Lower power consumption, faster readout speeds, potential for on-chip processing (e.g., noise reduction, HDR), less blooming, lower cost due to standard manufacturing processes.
    * *Cons:* Historically lower sensitivity and higher noise (fixed pattern noise) than CCD, though the gap has narrowed significantly.

**Color Imaging:** Typically achieved using a **Bayer filter mosaic** over a single sensor (CCD or CMOS), where alternating pixels are sensitive to Red, Green, or Blue light (often with twice as many Green pixels). A demosaicing algorithm interpolates the missing color information for each pixel. Higher-end systems might use 3 separate sensors with a prism to split light.

## Key Camera Parameters

* **Resolution:** Number of pixels in the image sensor (e.g., 640x480, 1920x1080, megapixels). Determines spatial detail.
* **Focal Length (f):** Distance from the optical center to the image plane when focused at infinity. Affects magnification and Field of View (FoV).
* **Field of View (FoV):** The angular extent of the scene captured by the camera. Inversely related to focal length (longer focal length = narrower FoV).
* **Aperture (Iris, f-number):** Controls the amount of light entering the lens. Affects image brightness and depth of field (range of distances in focus).
* **Shutter Speed (Integration Time):** Duration for which the sensor collects light for each frame. Affects image brightness and motion blur (longer shutter speed = more motion blur).
* **Frame Rate:** Number of images captured per second (e.g., 30 fps, 60 fps). Determines temporal resolution. Limited by sensor readout speed and bandwidth.
* **Dynamic Range:** Ratio between the maximum and minimum light intensities the sensor can capture simultaneously. High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging techniques combine multiple exposures.
* **Gain (ISO):** Electronic amplification of the sensor signal. Increases brightness but also amplifies noise.
* **White Balance:** Adjusts color representation to make white objects appear white under different lighting conditions (for color cameras).

## Types of Camera Systems in Robotics

* **Monocular Camera:** A single camera. Provides rich 2D appearance information but cannot directly measure depth from a single image. Depth requires motion (Structure from Motion - SfM) or assumptions about the scene.
* **[[Stereo Vision|Stereo Camera]]:** Two or more cameras with a known relative pose (baseline). Enables 3D depth perception via triangulation by finding corresponding points in the different images. The accuracy of depth estimation depends on the baseline length and image resolution.
* **[[RGB-D Sensor|RGB-D Camera]]:** Provides both color (RGB) and per-pixel depth (D) information, creating a "2.5D" image. Common technologies include:
    * *Structured Light:* Projects known infrared patterns onto the scene; depth is inferred from pattern deformation.
    * *Time-of-Flight (ToF):* Measures the time it takes for emitted light (often infrared) to travel to the scene and back to the sensor.
* **Omnidirectional Camera:** Captures a wide field of view, often 360Â° horizontally. Achieved using special lenses (fisheye) or mirrors (catadioptric systems). Useful for situational awareness, [[Localization]], and [[SLAM]].
* **Event-Based Camera (Neuromorphic/Dynamic Vision Sensor):** Asynchronous sensor that outputs "events" corresponding to changes in brightness at individual pixels, rather than full frames at fixed intervals. Advantages include very high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, and low power consumption. Promising for tracking high-speed motion.
* **Thermal/Infrared Camera:** Detects infrared radiation (heat). Useful for detecting humans/animals, identifying hot spots, or seeing in complete darkness.

## Applications in Robotics

Camera systems are integral to numerous robotics applications:

* **[[Perception]]:** Core sensor for [[Computer Vision]] tasks like object detection, recognition, tracking, and semantic segmentation (understanding scene content).
* **[[Localization]], Mapping, and [[SLAM]]:** Enables [[Visual Odometry]] (estimating robot motion from visual changes), Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) for map building and localization, and place recognition (identifying previously visited locations). Often fused with [[IMU_Sensors]] (Visual-Inertial Odometry/SLAM - VIO/VI-SLAM) for improved robustness.
* **Navigation:** Detecting obstacles, identifying navigable paths (e.g., road/lane tracking), reading signs, visual servoing for goal reaching.
* **Manipulation:** Visually locating objects for grasping, tracking object pose during manipulation, visual servoing for precise alignment (e.g., peg-in-hole).
* **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Detecting and recognizing humans, tracking faces and gaze, interpreting gestures and expressions.
* **Inspection:** Automated visual inspection for quality control, surface defect detection, infrastructure monitoring.

## Challenges

Despite their power, camera systems face challenges:

* **Illumination Sensitivity:** Performance heavily depends on ambient lighting conditions (too dark, too bright, changing light, shadows, glare).
* **Limited Dynamic Range:** Standard cameras struggle to capture details in scenes with both very bright and very dark regions simultaneously.
* **Motion Blur:** Fast robot or scene motion combined with longer shutter speeds can blur images.
* **Occlusions:** Objects can be partially or fully hidden from view.
* **Calibration:** Accurate intrinsic and extrinsic ([[Sensor_Calibration_Techniques|camera calibration]]) parameters are needed for metric 3D reconstruction and precise visual servoing.
* **Computational Cost:** Processing high-resolution image streams in real-time requires significant computational power.
