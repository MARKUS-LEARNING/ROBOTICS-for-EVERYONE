# Piezoelectricity

**Piezoelectricity** is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials, such as crystals and ceramics, in response to applied mechanical stress. This phenomenon is reversible, meaning that these materials can also change shape when an electric field is applied. Piezoelectricity is widely used in sensors and actuators in robotic systems, enabling precise measurement and control of mechanical forces and displacements.

## Principles of Piezoelectricity

1. **Direct Piezoelectric Effect**: The generation of an electric charge in response to mechanical stress. This effect is used in sensors to measure forces, accelerations, and pressures.
2. **Converse Piezoelectric Effect**: The deformation of a material in response to an applied electric field. This effect is used in actuators to produce precise movements and vibrations.

## Key Equations

- **Direct Piezoelectric Effect**:
  $$
  D = d \cdot T
  $$
  where $D$ is the electric displacement, $d$ is the piezoelectric charge constant, and $T$ is the applied stress.
  <br></br>

- **Converse Piezoelectric Effect**:
  $$
  S = d^* \cdot E
  $$
  where $S$ is the mechanical strain, $d^*$ is the transpose of the piezoelectric strain constant, and $E$ is the applied electric field.
  <br></br>

- **Piezoelectric Constitutive Equations**:
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  D = \epsilon^T \cdot E + d \cdot T \\
  S = s^E \cdot T + d^* \cdot E
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $\epsilon^T$ is the permittivity at constant stress, $s^E$ is the compliance at constant electric field, $E$ is the electric field, and $T$ is the stress.
