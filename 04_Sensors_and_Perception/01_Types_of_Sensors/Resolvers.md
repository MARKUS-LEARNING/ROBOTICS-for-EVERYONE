# Resolvers

**Resolvers** are rotary transformers used to measure the angular position, velocity, and acceleration of a rotating component. They provide precise feedback in robotic systems, enabling accurate control and monitoring of rotational motion. Resolvers are commonly used in high-performance applications such as industrial robotics, aerospace, and automotive systems.

## Types of Resolvers

1. **Brushless Resolvers**:
   - Utilize a transformer-based design without brushes, offering high reliability and longevity.
   - Suitable for applications requiring minimal maintenance and high durability.

2. **Brush-Type Resolvers**:
   - Use brushes to transmit signals, typically offering lower cost but requiring more maintenance.
   - Common in less demanding applications.

## Key Equations

- **Angular Position**:
  $$
  \theta = \frac{V_o}{K_r}
  $$
  where $\theta$ is the angular position, $V_o$ is the output voltage, and $K_r$ is the resolver constant.
  <br></br>

- **Angular Velocity**:
  $$
  \omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
  $$
  where $\omega$ is the angular velocity, and $\theta$ is the angular position as a function of time.
  <br></br>

- **Angular Acceleration**:
  $$
  \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt}
  $$
  where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity as a function of time.
