# Computer Vision in Robotics

**Computer Vision (CV)** in the context of robotics is a field of [[AI_and_Robot_Control]] and engineering focused on enabling robots to "see" – to acquire, process, analyze, and interpret visual information from the environment using [[Camera_Systems]] and associated algorithms. Its goal is to extract meaningful information from images or video streams to understand the scene, identify objects, track motion, and ultimately guide robot actions and decision-making.

## Purpose in Robotics

Vision is arguably the richest sensory modality for both humans and robots operating in complex, unstructured environments. Computer vision aims to provide robots with capabilities analogous to biological vision, enabling them to:

* **Understand their surroundings:** Identify objects, surfaces, free space, and potential hazards.
* **Interact physically:** Locate and estimate the pose of objects for manipulation and grasping.
* **Navigate autonomously:** Build maps ([[SLAM]]), estimate their own motion ([[Visual Odometry]]), [[Localization|localize]] themselves, and follow paths while avoiding obstacles.
* **Collaborate with humans:** Recognize people, interpret gestures and actions, and understand shared workspaces ([[Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)|HRI]]).

## Key Tasks and Applications

Computer vision enables a wide array of robotic tasks:

* **Object Detection, Recognition, and Segmentation:** Identifying instances of specific object classes (e.g., "cup", "chair") within an image (Recognition), determining their location usually via bounding boxes (Detection), and precisely delineating the pixels belonging to each object instance (Segmentation). This is fundamental for interaction and scene understanding.
* **[[Pose Estimation]]:** Estimating the 6-DoF position and orientation of known objects relative to the camera or robot, crucial for manipulation. Can also refer to estimating the camera/robot pose itself relative to the world (part of VO/SLAM).
* **Tracking:** Following the movement of objects, features, or people across consecutive image frames.
* **Scene Reconstruction & 3D Vision:** Creating 3D models of the environment from 2D images, using techniques like [[Stereo Vision]] or Structure from Motion (SfM), or increasingly, using methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for view synthesis and implicit geometry representation.
* **[[Visual Odometry]] (VO):** Estimating the robot's egomotion incrementally by tracking the apparent motion of visual features in the camera images. Often combined with [[IMU_Sensors]] data (Visual-Inertial Odometry - VIO) for robustness.
* **Visual [[SLAM]]:** Using primarily visual information to simultaneously build a map of an unknown environment and localize the robot within it.
* **[[Visual Servoing]]:** Using visual features directly in the feedback control loop to guide the robot's motion relative to a target or desired visual configuration.
* **Inspection:** Automating visual inspection tasks for manufacturing quality control, surface analysis, or infrastructure monitoring.
* **Place Recognition:** Identifying if a currently viewed scene corresponds to a previously visited location, crucial for [[Loop Closure]] in SLAM and global localization.
* **[[Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)|Human-Robot Interaction]]:** Recognizing faces, tracking gaze, identifying gestures, understanding activities.

## Sensors

The primary sensor for computer vision is the [[Camera_Systems|camera]]. Different types are used depending on the application:
* **Monocular Cameras:** Single cameras providing 2D information.
* **[[Stereo Vision|Stereo Cameras]]:** Provide depth information through triangulation.
* **[[RGB-D Sensor|RGB-D Cameras]]:** Provide registered color and dense depth images (e.g., using Structured Light or Time-of-Flight).
* **Omnidirectional Cameras:** Offer 360° views.
* **Event-Based Cameras:** High speed, high dynamic range sensing of intensity changes.
* **Thermal/Infrared Cameras:** Sense heat signatures.

## Core Techniques and Algorithms

Computer vision employs a vast range of algorithms, evolving rapidly with advances in [[Machine Learning]].

* **Classical Image Processing:**
    * *Preprocessing:* Noise reduction (e.g., Gaussian filtering), contrast enhancement.
    * *Feature Detection:* Identifying salient points (e.g., Harris, Shi-Tomasi corners), edges (e.g., Canny edge detector), lines (e.g., Hough transform), or blobs.
    * *Feature Descriptors:* Creating robust representations of local image patches around detected features (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB) for matching across different views or lighting conditions.
* **Geometric Computer Vision:**
    * *[[Stereo Vision]]:* Epipolar geometry, disparity calculation, triangulation.
    * *Structure from Motion (SfM):* Reconstructing 3D structure and camera motion from multiple 2D views.
    * *Projective Geometry:* Mathematical framework for perspective imaging.
* **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:**
    * *[[Deep Learning]]:* Dominates many current state-of-the-art results.
        * **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Foundation for image classification, object detection (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet), and semantic/instance segmentation (e.g., U-Net, Mask R-CNN).
        * **Vision Transformers (ViTs):** Increasingly used for various vision tasks, sometimes outperforming CNNs.
        * **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs) Used for processing sequential data like video for tracking or activity recognition.
        * **Generative Models:** (e.g., GANs, Diffusion Models, NeRFs) Used for image synthesis, data augmentation, and novel view/scene synthesis.
    * *Classical Machine Learning:* Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, etc., still used, sometimes in conjunction with deep features.
* **Foundation Models:** Large pre-trained models, often combining vision and language (Vision-Language Models - VLMs) or vision, language, and action (Vision-Language-Action models - VLAs), are being leveraged for high-level scene understanding, instruction following, and generating robot control policies.

## Challenges

Despite significant progress, computer vision in robotics faces ongoing challenges:

* **Robustness to Variations:** Handling changes in illumination, viewpoint, scale, weather conditions.
* **Occlusion and Clutter:** Dealing with objects being partially or fully hidden, and distinguishing objects in cluttered scenes.
* **Dynamic Environments:** Perceiving and reacting to moving objects and environmental changes.
* **Real-Time Performance:** Processing high-bandwidth visual data within the constraints of robot control loops.
* **Calibration:** Requiring accurate intrinsic and extrinsic [[Sensor_Calibration_Techniques]].
* **Data Requirements:** [[Deep Learning]] models often require large amounts of labeled training data.
* **Sim-to-Real Gap:** Transferring models trained in simulation to perform reliably in the real world.
* **Computational Cost:** Demanding significant processing power, especially for complex deep learning models.

Computer vision is a dynamic field continuously evolving, driven by algorithmic innovations (especially in AI/ML) and improvements in sensor technology, enabling increasingly sophisticated perceptual capabilities for robots.
