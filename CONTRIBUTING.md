## AI Agent

I built an AI agent in Mistral, accessing an extensive dataset of top robotics textbooks, research papers, and deep research conducted by Gemini 2.5, ChatGPT, Claude. Each tool is used to cross-reference content, equations, and linting code for syntax. This is an opportunity for contributions from the community to build out content as the field continues to grow rapidly.

## Review Process
