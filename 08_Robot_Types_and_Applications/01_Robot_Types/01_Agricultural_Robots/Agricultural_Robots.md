# Agricultural Robots (Agribots / Agbots)

**Agricultural Robots**, often called **Agribots** or **Agbots**, are robots designed specifically for use in agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, and forestry. They aim to automate repetitive, labor-intensive, or complex tasks, leading to increased efficiency, reduced labor costs, improved resource management (e.g., water, fertilizer, pesticides), enhanced crop yields, and enabling practices like [[Precision Agriculture]].

## Key Applications

Robots are being developed and deployed across the entire agricultural cycle:

1.  **Field Preparation & Planting:**
    * **Autonomous Tractors:** Large [[Mobile_Robots|mobile platforms]] capable of autonomous plowing, tilling, and seeding, often guided by high-precision [[GPS]] (RTK) and other sensors like [[LIDAR]] for obstacle avoidance.
    * **Robotic Planters:** Systems for precisely placing seeds or transplanting seedlings at optimal spacing and depth.

    *(Example: Autonomous tractor potentially performing planting)*

2.  **Crop Monitoring & Management:**
    * **Scouting Robots:** Ground-based mobile robots or [[Drones]] equipped with [[Camera_Systems|Camera Systems]] (including multispectral or thermal cameras) and other [[Sensor|sensors]] to monitor crop health, detect diseases or pest infestations, assess soil moisture, and estimate yield.
    * **Precision Spraying/Fertilizing:** Robots that apply pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers only where needed, identified through sensor data and [[Computer Vision in Robotics|computer vision]], minimizing chemical usage.

    *(Example: Agricultural drone likely used for crop monitoring or spraying)*

3.  **Weeding:**
    * **Automated Weeders:** Robots using [[Computer Vision in Robotics|vision systems]] to distinguish between crops and weeds, then removing weeds either mechanically (e.g., using small robotic tools) or via highly targeted micro-spraying of herbicides.

4.  **Harvesting:**
    * **Robotic Harvesters:** Often the most complex Agribots, designed to autonomously harvest crops like fruits (strawberries, apples, citrus), vegetables (lettuce, asparagus), or broadacre crops. Requires advanced [[Perception]] to identify ripe produce and delicate [[Manipulation]] to pick without damage.

    *(Example: Robotic arm harvesting strawberries)*

5.  **Livestock Management:**
    * **Robotic Milking Systems:** Automated systems that allow cows to be milked voluntarily, identifying the cow and attaching milking equipment automatically.
    * **Automated Feeding Systems:** Robots that prepare and distribute feed rations.
    * **Health Monitoring:** Sensors and cameras used to monitor animal behavior, feeding patterns, and vital signs for early detection of health issues.

6.  **Forestry & Aquaculture:** Robots are also used for tasks like automated tree planting/felling, fish feeding, and monitoring water quality.

## Types of Robots Used

* **Autonomous Tractors & Large [[Mobile_Robots|Mobile Platforms]]:** For tasks covering large field areas.
* **Small Mobile Robots:** Designed for specific tasks like weeding or monitoring within crop rows.
* **[[Drones]] / Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs):** Primarily for aerial imaging, mapping, and spraying.
* **[[Manipulator_Arm_Types|Robotic Arms]]:** Often mounted on mobile bases or fixed stations for harvesting, milking, or precise planting.
* **Specialized Systems:** Custom-designed robots for specific tasks (e.g., robotic milking parlors).

## Key Enabling Technologies

* **[[Navigation]]:** Robust outdoor navigation is crucial, often using [[GPS]] (RTK for cm-level accuracy), [[IMU_Sensors]], wheel [[Odometry]], [[LIDAR]], and/or [[Visual Odometry]]/[[SLAM]]. Path planning often involves following predefined row patterns or area coverage strategies.
* **[[Perception]]:** [[Computer Vision in Robotics]] is essential for identifying crops vs. weeds, detecting fruits and assessing ripeness, recognizing animals, and navigating using visual cues. [[LIDAR]] aids in 3D mapping and obstacle detection. Multispectral and thermal imaging provide information about plant health or soil conditions.
* **[[Manipulation]]:** Dexterous grippers and end-effectors capable of handling delicate biological products without damage are needed for harvesting and handling tasks.
* **[[AI_and_Robot_Control]]:** [[Machine Learning]] (especially [[Deep Learning]]) powers perception systems. [[Control Theory]] and [[Reinforcement Learning for Robots|RL]] are used for precise motion control and learning complex tasks like harvesting or navigating difficult terrain. [[Decision Making|Decision-making]] algorithms determine optimal actions based on sensor data (e.g., which fruit to pick, where to apply fertilizer).

## Challenges

* **Harsh & Unstructured Environments:** Robots must operate reliably outdoors under varying weather conditions (sun, rain, wind, dust), on uneven and muddy terrain, and amongst variable natural obstacles.
* **Variability:** Dealing with the inherent variability and unpredictability of biological systems (plants grow differently, fruits ripen unevenly, animals move).
* **Perception Reliability:** Robustly identifying objects (crops, weeds, fruits, obstacles) under changing lighting, occlusion, and background clutter remains difficult.
* **Manipulation Dexterity:** Matching human dexterity for delicate tasks like fruit picking is challenging.
* **Cost & ROI:** High initial cost of robotic systems can be a barrier for adoption, requiring clear return on investment.
* **Reliability & Maintenance:** Systems need to be robust and easily maintainable for farm use.
* **Integration:** Fitting robotic systems into existing farm infrastructure and workflows.
* **Power Management:** Ensuring sufficient battery life or power supply for robots operating over large areas for extended periods.

Agricultural robotics is a rapidly growing field driven by the need for increased food production, resource efficiency, and solutions to labor shortages in the agricultural sector.
