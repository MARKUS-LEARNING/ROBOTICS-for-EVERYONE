# Probabilistic Robotics

**Probabilistic Robotics** is a framework that uses probabilistic models and algorithms to handle uncertainty in robotic systems. It enables robots to make decisions and operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments by representing and reasoning about uncertainty in sensor data, models, and actions. Probabilistic robotics is essential for tasks such as localization, mapping, and decision-making.

## Key Concepts in Probabilistic Robotics

1. **Uncertainty**: The inherent variability and noise in sensor data, models, and actions, which probabilistic methods aim to quantify and manage.

2. **Probabilistic Models**: Mathematical representations of the system or environment that incorporate uncertainty, often using probability distributions.

3. **Bayesian Inference**: A framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence, central to many probabilistic algorithms in robotics.

4. **Estimation**: The process of approximating or predicting unknown quantities, such as positions or states, based on available data.

5. **Decision-Making**: Using probabilistic models to make informed decisions under uncertainty, often involving the maximization of expected utility or reward.

## Mathematical Representations

### Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is a fundamental concept in probabilistic robotics, used to update beliefs based on new evidence. The posterior distribution is computed using Bayes' theorem:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

where $P(A|B)$ is the posterior probability, $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, $P(A)$ is the prior probability, and $P(B)$ is the marginal likelihood.

### Markov Models

Markov models are used to represent systems where the future state depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. The transition probability is given by:

$$
P(x_{t+1} | x_t)
$$

where $x_t$ is the state at time $t$, and $x_{t+1}$ is the state at the next time step.

### Kalman Filter

The Kalman Filter is a recursive algorithm used to estimate the state of a linear dynamic system with Gaussian noise. It involves prediction and update steps to refine the state estimate based on new measurements.

### Particle Filter

The Particle Filter is a non-parametric estimation technique suitable for non-linear systems. It represents the probability distribution of the state using a set of particles, which are updated based on new measurements.

## Applications of Probabilistic Robotics

Probabilistic robotics is applied in various robotic tasks:

- **Localization**: Estimating the robot's position and orientation within the environment, often using techniques like the Kalman Filter or Particle Filter.
- **Mapping**: Building a map of the environment while accounting for uncertainties in sensor data and robot motion.
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Combining localization and mapping to enable robots to navigate and interact with unknown environments.
- **Decision-Making**: Using probabilistic models to make informed decisions under uncertainty, such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.
