# Path Planning

**Path Planning** is the process of finding an optimal or feasible path for a robot to travel from a start location to a goal location while avoiding obstacles. It is a fundamental aspect of autonomous navigation, enabling robots to move efficiently and safely through their environment. Path planning involves the use of algorithms and techniques to compute paths that minimize criteria such as distance, time, or energy consumption, while ensuring collision-free navigation.

## Key Concepts in Path Planning

1. **Start and Goal Locations**: The initial and final positions between which the path is to be planned.

2. **Obstacles**: Objects or regions in the environment that the robot must avoid while navigating.

3. **Cost Function**: A function that quantifies the desirability of a path, often based on criteria such as distance, time, or energy consumption.

4. **Search Algorithms**: Algorithms used to explore the possible paths in the environment, such as A\*, Dijkstra's algorithm, and RRT.

5. **Optimization**: The process of finding the best path according to the defined cost function.

6. **Feasibility**: Ensuring that the planned path is physically possible and collision-free.

## Mathematical Representations

### A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is a popular path planning algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search for the optimal path. The cost function $f(n)$ for a node $n$ is given by:

$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

where $g(n)$ is the cost from the start node to the current node $n$, and $h(n)$ is the heuristic estimate of the cost from $n$ to the goal.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in a graph. It is often used for path planning in environments with uniform costs. The algorithm iteratively updates the cost $d(n)$ for each node $n$:

$$
d(n) = \min(d(n), d(m) + c(m, n))
$$

where $d(n)$ is the minimum cost to reach node $n$, $d(m)$ is the cost to reach the neighboring node $m$, and $c(m, n)$ is the cost to travel from $m$ to $n$.

### Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)

RRT is a sampling-based algorithm used for path planning in high-dimensional spaces. It builds a tree of possible paths by randomly sampling the environment and connecting the samples to the nearest node in the tree. The algorithm iteratively grows the tree until a path to the goal is found.

### Potential Fields

Potential field methods use artificial potential fields to guide the robot towards the goal while avoiding obstacles. The total potential $U(q)$ at a configuration $q$ is given by:

$$
U(q) = U_{\text{attr}}(q) + U_{\text{rep}}(q)
$$

where $U_{\text{attr}}(q)$ is the attractive potential pulling the robot towards the goal, and $U_{\text{rep}}(q)$ is the repulsive potential pushing the robot away from obstacles.

## Applications of Path Planning

Path planning is essential in various robotic applications:

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Enabling self-driving cars, drones, and underwater vehicles to navigate safely through their environments, avoiding collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
- **Mobile Robots**: Allowing robots to move through warehouses, offices, and other indoor environments without colliding with objects or people.
- **Service Robots**: Ensuring that robots can operate safely in human environments, such as homes, hospitals, and public spaces.
- **Industrial Automation**: Enabling robots to navigate through manufacturing facilities, avoiding machinery and other obstacles.
