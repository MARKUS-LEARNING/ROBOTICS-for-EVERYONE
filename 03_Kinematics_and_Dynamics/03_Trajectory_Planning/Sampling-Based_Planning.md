# Sampling-Based Planning

**Sampling-Based Planning** is a method used in robotics for motion planning that relies on random sampling to explore the configuration space and find feasible paths. This approach is particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces where traditional search methods may be inefficient or infeasible.

## Key Concepts

* **Sampling:** The process of randomly selecting points in the configuration space to explore potential paths.
* **Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM):** A graph-based method that constructs a roadmap of the configuration space using random samples and connects them to form a network of possible paths.
* **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT):** A tree-based method that incrementally builds a tree of possible paths by randomly sampling the configuration space and extending the tree towards the samples.
* **Feasibility:** A path is considered feasible if it does not collide with obstacles and satisfies the robot's kinematic and dynamic constraints.

## Methods

### 1. Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM)

* **Concept:** Constructs a graph where nodes represent randomly sampled configurations, and edges represent feasible paths between them.
* **Steps:**
  1. Randomly sample the configuration space to generate a set of nodes.
  2. Attempt to connect each node to its nearest neighbors using a local planner.
  3. Use a graph search algorithm (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's) to find a path from the start to the goal configuration.
* **Pros:**
  * Efficient for high-dimensional spaces.
  * Can handle complex environments with many obstacles.
* **Cons:**
  * Requires a large number of samples for dense coverage.
  * May not find a path if the sampling is not sufficient.

### 2. Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)

* **Concept:** Incrementally builds a tree of possible paths by randomly sampling the configuration space and extending the tree towards the samples.
* **Steps:**
  1. Initialize the tree with the start configuration.
  2. Randomly sample the configuration space.
  3. Find the nearest node in the tree to the sample.
  4. Extend the tree from the nearest node towards the sample.
  5. Repeat until the goal configuration is reached or a timeout occurs.
* **Pros:**
  * Efficient for exploring large and complex configuration spaces.
  * Can handle dynamic environments by replanning.
* **Cons:**
  * The resulting path may not be optimal.
  * Requires careful tuning of parameters for efficient exploration.

## Mathematical Representation

### Sampling Process

The sampling process involves selecting random points $q$ in the configuration space $\mathcal{C}$:

$$
q \in \mathcal{C}
$$

### Path Feasibility

A path $\pi$ is feasible if it does not intersect with any obstacle $\mathcal{O}$:

$$
\pi \cap \mathcal{O} = \emptyset
$$

### Probabilistic Completeness

A sampling-based planner is probabilistically complete if the probability of finding a solution approaches 1 as the number of samples $n$ approaches infinity:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} P(\text{solution found}) = 1
$$

## Applications

Sampling-based planning is widely used in various robotic applications, including:

* **Mobile Robots:** Navigating through complex environments with obstacles.
* **Manipulator Arms:** Planning paths for tasks like assembly, welding, or pick-and-place operations.
* **Autonomous Vehicles:** Planning safe and efficient routes for self-driving cars, drones, or underwater vehicles.
* **Human-Robot Interaction:** Ensuring safe operation when robots interact with humans in shared workspaces.

---

## Challenges

* **Sampling Density:** Ensuring sufficient coverage of the configuration space with a limited number of samples.
* **Dynamic Environments:** Adapting to changes in the environment in real-time.
* **Optimality:** Finding not just any feasible path, but an optimal one in terms of length, time, or energy.
