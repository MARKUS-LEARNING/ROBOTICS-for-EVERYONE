# Newton-Euler Equations

The **Newton-Euler Equations** are fundamental equations in dynamics that describe the relationship between forces, torques, and the motion of rigid bodies. They are essential for analyzing and controlling the motion of robotic systems, particularly in applications involving manipulation, navigation, and stability. These equations provide a framework for understanding how external forces and torques influence the linear and angular motion of a rigid body.

## Key Concepts

1. **Forces**: External influences that cause linear acceleration of a rigid body. They are described by Newton's second law of motion.

2. **Torques**: External influences that cause angular acceleration of a rigid body. They are described by Euler's equations of motion.

3. **Linear Motion**: Described by Newton's second law, which relates the net force acting on a body to its linear acceleration.

4. **Angular Motion**: Described by Euler's equations, which relate the net torque acting on a body to its angular acceleration.

5. **Inertia**: The resistance of a body to changes in its state of motion, which affects both linear and angular acceleration.

## Mathematical Representations

### Newton's Second Law

Newton's second law describes the relationship between the net force acting on a body and its linear acceleration:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

where $F$ is the net force, $m$ is the mass of the body, and $a$ is the linear acceleration.

### Euler's Equations of Motion

Euler's equations describe the relationship between the net torque acting on a body and its angular acceleration:

$$
\tau = I \cdot \alpha
$$

where $\tau$ is the net torque, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

### Combined Newton-Euler Equations

For a rigid body, the combined Newton-Euler equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{cases}
F = m \cdot a \\
\tau = I \cdot \alpha
\end{cases}
$$

These equations describe the dynamics of a rigid body under the influence of external forces and torques.

## Applications of Newton-Euler Equations

The Newton-Euler equations are applied in various robotic contexts:

- **Manipulator Dynamics**: Analyzing the forces and torques required to move and control robotic arms and manipulators.
- **Vehicle Dynamics**: Studying the motion of vehicles, including cars, aircraft, and spacecraft, under the influence of external forces and torques.
- **Control Systems**: Designing algorithms to control the motion of robotic systems, ensuring stability and precision.
- **Simulation**: Predicting the behavior of robotic systems under different conditions to optimize performance and safety.
