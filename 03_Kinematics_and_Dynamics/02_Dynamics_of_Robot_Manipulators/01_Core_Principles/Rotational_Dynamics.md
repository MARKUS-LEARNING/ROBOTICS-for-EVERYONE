# Rotational Dynamics

**Rotational Dynamics** is the study of the motion of objects as they rotate around an axis. It focuses on the relationship between torque, angular momentum, and angular acceleration, providing the foundation for understanding and controlling rotational motion in robotic systems. Rotational dynamics is crucial for analyzing and designing systems involving rotating components, such as robotic arms, wheels, and gyroscopes.

## Key Concepts in Rotational Dynamics

1. **Angular Velocity**: The rate at which an object rotates, measured in radians per second. It is a vector quantity that points along the axis of rotation.

2. **Angular Acceleration**: The rate of change of angular velocity, which is caused by a net torque acting on the object.

3. **Moment of Inertia**: A measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotational motion, depending on its mass distribution.

4. **Angular Momentum**: A measure of the amount of rotation an object has, taking into account its moment of inertia and angular velocity.

5. **Torque**: The rotational equivalent of force, causing a change in angular momentum. It is the product of the force applied and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied.

6. **Gyroscopic Effects**: Phenomena observed in rotating systems that maintain their orientation due to the conservation of angular momentum.

## Mathematical Representations

### Angular Momentum

The angular momentum $L$ of a rigid body rotating about an axis is given by:

$$
L = I \cdot \omega
$$

where $L$ is the angular momentum, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity.

<br>

### Relationship with Torque

The time rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the applied torque $\tau$:

$$
\tau = \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

This relationship is fundamental to the analysis of rotational dynamics and is analogous to Newton's second law for linear motion.

<br>

### Angular Acceleration

The angular acceleration $\alpha$ of a rigid body is related to the applied torque $\tau$ through the moment of inertia $I$:

$$
\tau = I \cdot \alpha
$$

This equation describes how torque causes a change in the rotational motion of an object.

<br>

### Kinetic Energy

The kinetic energy $T$ of a rotating rigid body is given by:

$$
T = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
$$

where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is the angular velocity. This energy is associated with the rotational motion of the object.
