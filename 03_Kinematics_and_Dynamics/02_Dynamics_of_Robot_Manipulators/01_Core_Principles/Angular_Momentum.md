# Angular Momentum

**Angular Momentum** is a fundamental concept in rotational dynamics, representing the rotational analog of linear momentum. It is a measure of the amount of rotation an object has, taking into account its mass distribution and rotational velocity. Angular momentum is crucial for understanding and analyzing the behavior of rotating systems, such as robotic arms, wheels, and gyroscopes.

## Key Concepts in Angular Momentum

1. **Moment of Inertia**: A measure of how the mass of an object is distributed around its axis of rotation. It determines how difficult it is to change the object's rotational motion.
   <br>

2. **Angular Velocity**: The rate at which an object rotates, measured in radians per second. It is a vector quantity that points along the axis of rotation.
   <br>

3. **Torque**: The rotational equivalent of force, causing a change in angular momentum. It is the product of the force applied and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied.
   <br>

4. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: In a closed system, the total angular momentum remains constant unless acted upon by an external torque.

## Mathematical Representations

### Definition of Angular Momentum

The angular momentum $L$ of a rigid body rotating about an axis is given by:

$$
L = I \cdot \omega
$$

where:
- $L$ is the angular momentum.
- $I$ is the moment of inertia.
- $\omega$ is the angular velocity.

### Relationship with Torque

The time rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the applied torque $\tau$:

$$
\tau = \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

This relationship is analogous to Newton's second law for linear motion and is fundamental to the analysis of rotational dynamics.

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

In the absence of external torques, the angular momentum of a system is conserved:

$$
L = \text{constant}
$$

This principle is crucial for understanding the stability and behavior of rotating systems.

### Parallel Axis Theorem

The moment of inertia $I$ about any axis can be related to the moment of inertia $I_{\text{CM}}$ about a parallel axis through the center of mass:

$$
I = I_{\text{CM}} + m d^2
$$

where:
- $m$ is the mass of the object.
- $d$ is the perpendicular distance between the axes.
