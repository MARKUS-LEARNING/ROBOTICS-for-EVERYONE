# Forward Kinematics (FK)

**Forward Kinematics (FK)**, also known as **direct kinematics**, refers to the use of the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position and orientation of its end-effector (or tool frame) in a specific reference frame (typically the base frame or world frame), given the values of its joint parameters (angles for revolute joints, displacements for prismatic joints).

Essentially, forward kinematics solves the problem: **Given the joint configuration, where is the robot's end-effector?** This represents a mapping from the robot's [[Joint_Space]] to its [[Cartesian_Space]] or task space.

## Serial Manipulators

For serial manipulators (like typical robot arms), **forward kinematics** involves computing the cumulative transformations across each link in the [[Kinematic_Chains|kinematic chain]].

### Method

1. **Assign coordinate frames**:  
   Define frames ${0}$, ${1}$, ..., ${N}$ for the base and each link using a systematic conventionâ€”typically the [[DH_Parameters|Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention]].

2. **Define individual transformations**:  
   Compute the [[Homogeneous_Transformation_Matrix|homogeneous transformation matrix]] ${}^{i-1}T_i$, which relates frame ${i}$ to frame ${i-1}$. Each matrix depends on fixed link parameters (e.g., link length $a_i, twist \( \alpha_i$) and the joint variable $q_i$ (e.g., $\theta_i$ for revolute joints or $d_i$ for prismatic joints).

3. **Calculate the overall transformation** from the base to the end-effector by chaining link transformations:

$$
{}^0T_N = {}^0T_1 \cdot {}^1T_2 \cdot \dots \cdot {}^{N-1}T_N
$$

4. **Incorporate the tool frame** (if defined):  
   If a specific tool frame $\{T\}$ is attached to the final link frame $\{N\}$ via a constant transform ${}^N T_T$, the total transformation from base to tool is:

$$
{}^0T_T = {}^0T_N \cdot {}^N T_T
$$


* **Denavit-Hartenberg (DH):** The DH convention provides a standardized method for assigning link frames and defining the four parameters ($\theta_i, d_i, a_i, \alpha_i$) that characterize the transformation $^{i-1}T_i$.

* **Solution:** For serial chain manipulators, the forward kinematics problem generally has a unique, closed-form analytical solution. Given the joint values, calculating the end-effector pose is computationally straightforward.

## Mobile Robots

For mobile robots, the term "forward kinematics" typically refers to the instantaneous velocity relationships rather than static pose calculation from joint angles (as mobile robots usually don't have a fixed base in the same way manipulators do).

* **Concept:** It describes how the robot chassis's linear velocity ($v_x, v_y$) and angular velocity ($\omega_z$) in a chosen frame (local robot frame or global world frame) result from the velocities of its actuated components (e.g., wheel angular velocities $\phi_L, \phi_R$).
* **Example ([[Differential_Drive]]):** For a differential drive robot with wheel radius $r$ and wheel separation $b$, the forward kinematics relating wheel speeds to chassis velocity $(v_x, \omega_z)$ in the local frame are:

$$
v_x = \frac{r (\phi_R + \phi_L)}{2}
$$
    
$$
\omega_z = \frac{r (\phi_R - \phi_L)}{b}
$$

## Purpose and Application

Forward kinematics is fundamental in robotics for:

* **State Estimation:** Determining the current pose of the end-effector based on readings from joint sensors.
* **Trajectory Planning:** Verifying that planned points in joint space correspond to desired points in Cartesian space.
* **Control:** Computing the current end-effector pose or velocity for feedback control loops.
* **Simulation & Visualization:** Calculating the robot's geometry for display or physics simulation.

## Relation to Inverse Kinematics

Forward kinematics is the counterpart to [[Inverse_Kinematics]] (IK). While FK computes the end-effector pose from given joint values, IK computes the required joint values to achieve a desired end-effector pose. FK usually has a unique, easily computed solution, whereas IK is often more complex, potentially having multiple solutions, no solutions, or requiring numerical methods.
