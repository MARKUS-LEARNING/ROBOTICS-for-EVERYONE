# Kinematics

**Kinematics** is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of points, objects, and systems without considering the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, kinematics focuses on the geometric aspects of motion, including the position, velocity, acceleration, and orientation of robotic components. It is essential for understanding how robots move and interact with their environment, enabling precise control and task execution.

## Fundamental Concepts in Kinematics

1. **Degrees of Freedom**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration of a robotic system. Understanding the degrees of freedom is crucial for analyzing the robot's capabilities and constraints. For example, a robotic arm with six revolute joints has six degrees of freedom, allowing it to position its end-effector in three-dimensional space with any orientation.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The process of calculating the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint parameters. This is essential for understanding the robot's current configuration and planning its motion. Forward kinematics is used to determine the end-effector's pose based on the joint angles or positions.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**: The process of determining the joint parameters required to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector. This is crucial for task execution and control. Inverse kinematics is more complex than forward kinematics, as it often involves solving a system of nonlinear equations.

4. **Jacobian Matrix**: A matrix that relates the joint velocities to the end-effector velocities. It is crucial for understanding the robot's ability to move in different directions and for controlling its motion. The Jacobian matrix is used in both motion control and singularity analysis.

5. **Workspace**: The volume of space that the robot can reach with its end-effector, defining the operational limits of the robotic system. The workspace is divided into the reachable workspace and the dexterous workspace, which is the subset where the robot can achieve any arbitrary orientation.

6. **Singularities**: Configurations or states where the robotic system loses one or more degrees of freedom, leading to issues in control, motion, or force application. Singularities occur when the Jacobian matrix becomes singular, i.e., its determinant is zero.

7. **Homogeneous Transformation**: A mathematical representation used to describe the position and orientation of a rigid body in space. It combines rotation and translation into a single matrix, simplifying the kinematic analysis of robotic systems.

8. **Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters**: A standard method for representing the kinematic relationships between the links of a robotic manipulator. These parameters include the link length, joint angle, link offset, and twist angle, which are used to derive the forward kinematics of the robot.

## Key Equations in Kinematics

- **Forward Kinematics Equation**:
  $$
  T = f(\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n)
  $$
  where $T$ is the transformation matrix representing the position and orientation of the end-effector, and $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n$ are the joint variables. This equation is fundamental in [[Forward_Kinematics|Forward Kinematics]].
<br></br>
- **Inverse Kinematics Equation**:
  $$
  \theta = f^{-1}(T)
  $$
  where $\theta$ represents the joint variables, and $T$ is the desired transformation matrix for the end-effector. This equation is central to [[Inverse_Kinematics|Inverse Kinematics]].
<br></br>
- **Jacobian Matrix**:
  $$
  J = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial \theta_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial \theta_n} \\
  \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial \theta_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial \theta_n} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial \theta_1} & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial \theta_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial \theta_n}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix, $f_i$ are the forward kinematic equations, and $\theta_i$ are the joint variables. The Jacobian matrix is crucial for understanding the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.
<br></br>
- **Velocity Relationship**:
  $$
  \dot{X} = J \cdot \dot{\theta}
  $$
  where $\dot{X}$ is the end-effector velocity vector, $J$ is the Jacobian matrix, and $\dot{\theta}$ is the joint velocity vector. This equation relates the velocities of the joints to the velocity of the end-effector.
<br></br>
- **Homogeneous Transformation Matrix**:
  $$
  T = \begin{bmatrix}
  R & p \\
  0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
  where $R$ is the rotation matrix, and $p$ is the translation vector. This matrix is used in [[Homogeneous Transformation]] to represent the position and orientation of a rigid body in space.
<br></br>
- **Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters**:
  $$
  T_i = \text{Rot}_z(\theta_i) \cdot \text{Trans}_z(d_i) \cdot \text{Trans}_x(a_i) \cdot \text{Rot}_x(\alpha_i)
  $$
  where $\theta_i$ is the joint angle, $d_i$ is the link offset, $a_i$ is the link length, and $\alpha_i$ is the twist angle. These parameters are used to derive the forward kinematics of a robotic manipulator.

## Types of Kinematic Chains

1. **Serial Kinematic Chains**: Consist of a series of links connected in a chain, where each link is connected to the next by a joint. Serial chains are common in robotic arms and manipulators. They are characterized by their simplicity and flexibility but may suffer from reduced stiffness and accuracy.

2. **Parallel Kinematic Chains**: Consist of multiple kinematic chains working in parallel to connect the base to the end-effector. Parallel chains are often used in platforms and systems requiring high stiffness and precision. They offer improved load distribution and accuracy but may have limited workspace and complexity in control.

3. **Closed Kinematic Chains**: Form a loop, where the last link is connected back to the base. Closed chains are used in mechanisms requiring constrained motion, such as four-bar linkages. They provide high stiffness and precision but are more complex to analyze and control.
