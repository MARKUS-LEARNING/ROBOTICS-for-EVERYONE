# Cartesian Space

**Cartesian Space** is a three-dimensional coordinate system used to describe the position and orientation of objects. It provides a framework for spatial representation and analysis in robotics, enabling the precise description of locations and movements. Cartesian space is defined by three orthogonal axes: the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis, which intersect at the origin. This coordinate system is fundamental in robotics for tasks such as motion planning, control, and interaction with the environment.

## Key Concepts

### Coordinate Axes

Cartesian space is defined by three orthogonal axes: the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. These axes intersect at the origin and provide a reference frame for describing the position and orientation of objects in three-dimensional space.

### Position Representation

The position of a point in Cartesian space is represented by a set of coordinates (x, y, z), where x, y, and z are the distances from the origin along the respective axes. This representation is essential for describing the location of robotic components and objects in the environment.

### Transformation Matrices

Transformation matrices are used to describe the position and orientation of objects relative to different coordinate frames. They enable the computation of transformations such as translations and rotations, which are fundamental in kinematics and motion planning.

### Pose Representation

Pose representation involves describing the position and orientation of a robotic system or object in Cartesian space. It is essential for tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and interaction with the environment.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Position Vector

The position of a point in Cartesian space can be represented as a vector:

$$
\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the coordinates along the respective axes.

### Transformation Matrix

A transformation matrix $T$ for translating and rotating a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in Cartesian space can be represented as:

$$
T = \begin{bmatrix}
R & \mathbf{t} \\
\mathbf{0} & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where:
- $R$ is the rotation matrix.
- $\mathbf{t}$ is the translation vector.
- $\mathbf{0}$ is a zero vector.

### Example: Robotic Arm

Consider a robotic arm operating in Cartesian space. The position of the end-effector can be described using a position vector:

$$
\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}
$$

The transformation matrix is used to compute the position and orientation of the end-effector relative to the base of the robotic arm. This enables precise control and motion planning, allowing the arm to perform tasks such as grasping and manipulating objects.

## Applications in Robotics

- **Motion Planning**: Cartesian space is used to plan and optimize the motion of robotic systems, ensuring efficient and collision-free navigation.
- **Control Systems**: Provides the tools for designing control algorithms that regulate the behavior of robotic systems, enabling precise and stable operation.
- **Manipulation**: Enables the precise control of robotic manipulators to reach and manipulate objects within their workspace.
- **Localization and Mapping**: Cartesian space is used to represent and analyze the environment, enabling robots to localize themselves and build maps for navigation.
