# Mechanisms and Actuation

In [[Robotics]], **mechanisms** refer to the physical structures—such as [[Links|links]], [[Joint_Kinematics|joints]], gears, belts, and linkages—that constitute the "skeleton" of a robot and guide or transmit motion. **[[Actuator|Actuation]]**, on the other hand, refers to the components ([[Actuator|actuators]]) and process of converting stored energy (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic) into the forces and torques that *produce* this motion.

Mechanisms and actuation are fundamentally intertwined in robot design. [[Actuator|Actuators]] provide the power, while mechanisms shape, constrain, and transmit that power to achieve the desired movement of the robot's [[End-Effector]] or overall [[Locomotion]]. Understanding their relationship is crucial for designing effective and efficient robotic systems.

## Robot Mechanisms

The study of robot mechanisms often focuses on [[Kinematics]] (the geometry of motion) and [[Dynamics]] (the forces causing motion). Key mechanical elements include:

* **[[Kinematic_Chains|Kinematic Chains]]:** The sequence of [[Links|links]] and [[Joint_Kinematics|joints]] forming the robot's structure. These can be open chains (like most [[Manipulator_Arm|manipulator arms]]) or closed chains ([[Parallel_Mechanisms_and_Robots|parallel robots]], legs of a walking robot when multiple feet are on the ground). The type and arrangement determine the robot's [[Degrees_of_Freedom]] and [[Workspace]]. See [[Manipulator_Arm_Types]].
* **[[Transmission|Transmission Systems]]:** Mechanisms used to transfer power from an [[Actuator]] (often located proximally for reduced inertia) to a joint or output link. Common types include:
    * **[[Gearbox|Gears]]:** Spur, helical, bevel, worm gears. Used for speed reduction and torque amplification. Planetary gear trains and specialized low-backlash gears like harmonic drives (strain wave gearing) and cycloidal drives (e.g., Nabtesco RV gears) are common in robotics for compact, high-ratio reduction. Key characteristics are gear ratio, efficiency, stiffness, and backlash (play between teeth).
    * **Belts and Pulleys:** Timing belts provide synchronized motion transmission without slip. V-belts are simpler but allow slip. Used for moderate distances and ratios. Lower stiffness than gears, can introduce compliance.
    * **Cables / Tendons:** Lightweight, high tensile strength. Often used for remote actuation in [[Robot_Hands]] or lightweight arms. Require pre-tensioning. Can suffer from friction (especially in sheaths) and stretching (compliance).
    * **Linkages:** Combinations of rigid links (e.g., four-bar linkages, slider-cranks) used to create specific motion paths or coupling between joints (e.g., pantographs in some [[Legged Robots|legged robot]] designs).
    * **Ball Screws / Lead Screws:** Efficiently convert rotary motion (from a motor) into precise linear motion. Commonly used for [[Prismatic Joint|prismatic joints]] in [[Industrial_Arms|industrial robots]] or positioning stages.

## [[Actuator|Actuation]] Considerations

The choice and placement of actuators significantly impact the mechanism's performance. (See [[Actuator]] for detailed types: Electric, Hydraulic, Pneumatic, SMA, EAP, Piezoelectric).

* **Matching Actuator to Mechanism:** Actuator characteristics (torque/force output, speed range, power density, precision, back-drivability) must align with the demands of the mechanism and task. High-speed motors often require [[Transmission|transmissions]] (like [[Gearbox|gearboxes]]) to produce sufficient torque at the joint.
* **Actuation Placement:**
    * **[[Direct Drive]]:** Actuator coupled directly to the joint axis.
        * *Pros:* No transmission backlash or flexibility, potentially simpler mechanism, high control bandwidth.
        * *Cons:* Requires high-torque, low-speed actuators (often heavier/larger), increases inertia distal to the joint, poor inertia matching can occur.
    * **[[Remote_Actuation]]:** Actuator placed away from the joint (often closer to the base), power transmitted via mechanisms (gears, belts, tendons, linkages).
        * *Pros:* Reduces moving mass/inertia, allows use of smaller, higher-speed motors with reduction gearing, potentially better weight distribution.
        * *Cons:* Introduces transmission complexity, backlash, friction, and compliance, which can limit performance and complicate control.

## Design Considerations (Interplay of Mechanism & Actuation)

Effective robot design requires considering mechanisms and actuation together:

* **[[Kinematics]] & [[Degrees_of_Freedom]]:** The type and arrangement of joints in the mechanism define the robot's fundamental motion capabilities and DoF.
* **[[Dynamics]]:** The mechanism's mass and inertia distribution, combined with actuator power/torque limits, determine the robot's achievable accelerations and overall dynamic performance. [[Transmission]] efficiency affects required actuator power.
* **Stiffness & Compliance:** Overall system stiffness depends on both link/structural stiffness and the stiffness of joints, [[Actuator|actuators]], and [[Transmission|transmissions]]. Low stiffness can lead to vibrations and poor positioning accuracy. Controlled compliance can be beneficial for force control or safety.
* **Backlash & Friction:** Inherent properties of mechanisms (especially [[Transmission|transmissions]] like [[Gearbox|gears]]) that introduce play and energy loss, impacting precision positioning and control performance. [[Direct Drive]] eliminates transmission backlash.
* **Precision & Repeatability:** Affected by mechanism tolerances, joint/transmission backlash, [[Actuator]] resolution, [[Sensor|sensor]] accuracy, and controller performance.
* **Power & Efficiency:** Matching actuators and [[Transmission|transmissions]] to handle required loads efficiently throughout the [[Workspace]] and task cycle.
* **Integration & Packaging:** Fitting actuators, [[Transmission|transmissions]], wiring, and sensors within the physical volume constraints of the robot links and structure.

The design of a robot's mechanism and its actuation scheme fundamentally defines its physical capabilities and limitations, influencing everything from its [[Workspace]] and payload to its speed, precision, and suitability for specific tasks.
