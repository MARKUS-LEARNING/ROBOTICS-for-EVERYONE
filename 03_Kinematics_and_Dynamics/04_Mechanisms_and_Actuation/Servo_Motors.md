# Servo Motors

**Servo Motors** are self-contained electrical devices that rotate parts of a machine with precision. They incorporate a motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback, allowing for accurate control of angular position, velocity, and torque. Servo motors are widely used in robotics, particularly in applications requiring precise and dynamic movement, such as robotic arms, drones, and automated systems.

## Components of a Servo Motor

1. **DC Motor**: The core component that provides the mechanical power.
2. **Gear System**: Reduces the speed and increases the torque output of the motor.
3. **Position Sensor**: Typically a potentiometer or an encoder that provides feedback on the motor's position.
4. **Control Circuit**: A circuit that compares the desired position with the actual position and adjusts the motor's operation accordingly.

## Key Equations

- **Proportional Control**:
  $$
  u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t)
  $$
  where $u(t)$ is the control signal, $K_p$ is the proportional gain, and $e(t)$ is the error between the desired and actual position.
  <br></br>

- **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control**:
  $$
  u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) \, d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
  $$
  where $K_i$ is the integral gain, $K_d$ is the derivative gain, and $e(\tau)$ is the error over time.
  <br></br>

- **Torque**:
  $$
  \tau = K_t \cdot I
  $$
  where $\tau$ is the torque produced by the motor, $K_t$ is the torque constant, and $I$ is the current through the motor.

## Impact on Robotics

- **Precision Control**: Servo motors enable precise control of position, velocity, and torque, making them ideal for robotic applications that require accurate movement.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The integrated feedback system allows servo motors to correct errors in real-time, enhancing reliability and performance.
- **Design and Integration**: The selection and integration of servo motors are critical aspects of [[Robot_Design]] and [[Mechatronics]], influencing the overall performance and capabilities of robotic systems.
