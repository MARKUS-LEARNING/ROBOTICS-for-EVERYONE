## Types of Electric Motors

1. **[[DC_Motors|DC Motors]]**:
   - **Permanent Magnet DC Motors**: Utilize permanent magnets to generate a magnetic field. They are simple, reliable, and widely used in educational and hobbyist robots. Key characteristics include torque constant ($k_t$) and back-EMF.
   - **[[Brushless_DC_Motors|BLDC Motors]]**: Eliminate the need for brushes, offering higher reliability and efficiency. Common in modern industrial robots and drones.
   - **[[Stepper_Motors|Stepper Motors]]**: Rotate in discrete steps, ideal for precise positioning in low-cost robots. Often used in 3D printers and CNC machines.
   - **[[Servo_Motors|Servo Motors]]**: Combine a motor with a position sensor and controller for precise control of position, velocity, or torque. Common in robotic arms and [[Legged_Robots|Legged Robots]].

2. **AC Motors**:
   - **Induction Motors**: Robust and simple, often used in industrial applications where variable speed control is not critical.
   - **Synchronous Motors**: Provide precise speed control and are used in applications requiring constant speed regardless of load.
