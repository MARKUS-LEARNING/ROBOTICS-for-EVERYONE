# Ball Screw

A **Ball Screw** is a mechanical linear actuator that translates rotational motion into linear motion with high efficiency and precision. It consists of a screw shaft and a nut, both of which have matching helical grooves in which ball bearings roll. Ball screws are widely used in robotics and mechanical systems for applications requiring precise positioning, high load capacity, and smooth motion.

## Components of a Ball Screw

1. **Screw Shaft**: A cylindrical shaft with a helical groove along its length. The groove provides a path for the ball bearings to roll.
   <br>

2. **Nut**: A component with a matching helical groove that fits over the screw shaft. The nut moves linearly along the shaft as it rotates.
   <br>

3. **Ball Bearings**: Spherical bearings that roll within the grooves of the screw shaft and nut, reducing friction and enabling efficient motion transmission.
   <br>

4. **Recirculation System**: A mechanism that guides the ball bearings back to the starting point of the groove after they reach the end, allowing for continuous operation.

## Key Equations

### Lead of a Ball Screw

The lead $L$ of a ball screw is the distance it travels per revolution and is given by:

$$
L = n \cdot P
$$

where $n$ is the number of starts (threads), and $P$ is the pitch (distance between adjacent threads).

### Efficiency

The efficiency $\eta$ of a ball screw is calculated as:

$$
\eta = \frac{F_{\text{out}} \cdot L}{T \cdot 2\pi}
$$

where $F_{\text{out}}$ is the output force, $L$ is the lead, and $T$ is the input torque. Ball screws typically have high efficiency, often exceeding 90%.

### Linear Velocity

The linear velocity $v$ of the nut is given by:

$$
v = \frac{\omega \cdot L}{2\pi}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the screw shaft, and $L$ is the lead.
