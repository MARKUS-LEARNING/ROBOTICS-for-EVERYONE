# Hydraulic Systems in Robotics

**Hydraulic Systems** utilize pressurized, nearly incompressible fluids (typically mineral oil) to generate, control, and transmit power. In robotics, hydraulics are primarily used for [[Actuator|actuation]], powering [[Hydraulic Actuators]] (cylinders, motors) to move robot joints and [[Mechanisms and Actuation|mechanisms]]. They played a significant role in early industrial robotics due to their high power density.

## Principle of Operation

Hydraulic systems operate based on **Pascal's Law**: pressure applied to an enclosed, incompressible fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid. A typical system works as follows:
1.  A **pump** (usually driven by an electric motor) draws hydraulic fluid from a **reservoir**.
2.  The pump pressurizes the fluid.
3.  Control **valves** direct the flow of high-pressure fluid to specific ports on an [[Actuator|actuator]].
4.  The pressure difference across the actuator's piston or vanes generates force/torque, causing mechanical motion.
5.  Low-pressure fluid returns from the actuator, through valves, back to the reservoir, often passing through filters and coolers.

## Key Components

* **Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU):** The central power source.
    * **Reservoir:** Stores hydraulic fluid, allows for cooling and contaminant settling.
    * **Pump:** Creates fluid flow (e.g., gear pump, piston pump, vane pump). Driven by an electric motor or engine.
    * **Filters:** Remove contaminants from the fluid.
    * **Pressure Relief Valve:** Protects the system from overpressure.
    * **Cooler:** Dissipates heat generated by fluid friction and compression.
* **Control Valves:** Direct and regulate fluid flow and pressure.
    * **Directional Control Valves:** Switch flow paths (e.g., extend/retract cylinder). Can be simple on/off (solenoid valves) or proportional.
    * **Proportional/Servo Valves:** Allow precise, continuous control of flow rate or pressure, enabling closed-loop [[Control Systems|control]] of actuator position/velocity/force. Often complex and expensive.
    * **Pressure Control Valves:** Regulate system pressure (relief valves, pressure reducing valves).
    * **Flow Control Valves:** Regulate actuator speed.
* **[[Actuator|Hydraulic Actuators]]:** Convert hydraulic pressure into mechanical work.
    * **Linear Actuators (Cylinders/Pistons):** Produce linear force and motion.
    * **Rotary Actuators / Hydraulic Motors:** Produce torque and rotary motion.
* **Hydraulic Fluid:** The power transmission medium. Properties like viscosity, lubricity, thermal stability, and cleanliness are crucial.
* **Hoses, Pipes, Fittings:** Conduct the pressurized fluid between components. Must be rated for system pressure.
* **[[Sensors|Sensors]]:** Pressure sensors, temperature sensors, flow meters, level sensors, position sensors (on actuators).

## Advantages

* **High Force/Torque Density:** Hydraulic actuators can produce extremely large forces or torques from relatively compact packages compared to electric actuators.
* **High Power-to-Weight Ratio:** Excellent power output relative to the weight *of the actuator itself* (though the HPU can be heavy).
* **Stiffness:** Due to the near-incompressibility of hydraulic fluid, systems can exhibit high stiffness, useful for precise position holding under load.
* **Durability/Robustness:** Components can be robust and tolerate harsh operating environments (dust, vibration).

## Disadvantages

* **Complexity & Maintenance:** Requires a complex system of pumps, valves, hoses, filters, and fluid management. Regular maintenance (fluid checks, filter changes, seal replacements) is necessary.
* **Leaks:** Potential for fluid leaks, creating safety hazards (slip hazard, fire risk with flammable fluids) and environmental concerns. Requires careful sealing and monitoring.
* **Efficiency:** Overall energy efficiency can be lower than electric systems due to losses in the pump, control valves (throttling), and fluid friction in hoses. The pump often runs continuously, consuming power even when actuators are idle.
* **Bulkiness & Weight:** The HPU (pump, motor, reservoir, cooler) is often large, heavy, and noisy, typically requiring remote placement and long hose runs to the robot.
* **Control Complexity:** Precise closed-loop control requires sophisticated and expensive servo valves and advanced [[Control_Theory]] to manage the nonlinearities and dynamics of fluid flow.
* **Temperature Sensitivity:** Fluid viscosity changes significantly with temperature, affecting system performance and requiring temperature control (cooling/heating).
* **Cleanliness:** Maintaining fluid cleanliness is critical to prevent component wear and failure.

## Applications in Robotics

Hydraulics were dominant in early robotics and remain relevant where high force or power density is essential:

* **Heavy [[Industrial_Arms|Industrial Robots]]:** The first successful industrial robot, the [[Unimate]], was hydraulically powered. Hydraulics are still used in some very large robots requiring high payload capacity (e.g., foundry, forging, heavy material handling).
* **[[Legged_Robots|Legged Robots]]:** Early dynamically capable legged robots (like the Raibert Hopper, early Boston Dynamics prototypes such as BigDog and Atlas) utilized hydraulics to achieve the high peak power needed for dynamic gaits.
* **Construction & Mining Equipment:** Robotic or teleoperated excavators, loaders, and other heavy machinery rely on hydraulics.
* **Aerospace & Subsea:** Used for flight control surfaces, landing gear, and deep-sea [[ROV|ROVs]] and manipulators where power density and environmental tolerance are key.

**Trend:** In many modern robotics applications, particularly for medium-sized industrial arms and mobile robots, advances in [[Electric_Motors|electric motors]] (especially brushless DC/AC servos), high-ratio [[Gearbox|gearboxes]] (harmonic drives, cycloidal drives), and electric [[Actuator|linear actuators]] have led to electric drives replacing hydraulic systems. Electric systems generally offer simpler control, lower maintenance, higher cleanliness, and often better overall system efficiency, though potentially lower peak power density at the actuator itself. Hydraulics remain the preferred choice mainly in applications demanding exceptionally high force or power.
