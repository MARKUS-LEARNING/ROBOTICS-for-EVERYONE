# Gears

**Gears** are mechanical components used to transmit motion and power between rotating shafts, altering speed, torque, and direction. They are essential in robotics and mechanical systems for controlling the movement and force of various components. Gears enable precise and efficient power transmission, making them crucial for applications requiring controlled motion and torque.

## Types of Gears

1. **Spur Gears**:
   - Have straight teeth parallel to the axis of rotation.
   - Used for transmitting motion between parallel shafts.
   - Simple and efficient, but can be noisy at high speeds.

2. **Helical Gears**:
   - Have teeth cut at an angle to the axis, providing smoother and quieter operation.
   - Can transmit motion between non-parallel shafts.
   - Generate axial thrust, requiring proper bearing support.

3. **Bevel Gears**:
   - Have conical shapes, allowing motion transmission between intersecting shafts.
   - Used in applications like differential drives in vehicles.
   - Can be straight or spiral bevel gears for improved efficiency.

4. **Worm Gears**:
   - Consist of a worm (a screw-like gear) and a worm wheel.
   - Provide high gear reduction and compact design.
   - Suitable for applications requiring precise control and high torque.

5. **Planetary Gears**:
   - Consist of a central sun gear, planet gears, and a ring gear.
   - Provide compact and efficient power transmission.
   - Used in applications like automotive transmissions and robotic joints.

## Key Equations

- **Gear Ratio**:
  $$
  \text{Gear Ratio} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} = \frac{T_2}{T_1}
  $$
  where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the number of teeth on the input and output gears, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are the angular velocities, and $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the torques.
  <br></br>

- **Efficiency of Gear System**:
  $$
  \eta = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{P_{\text{in}}}
  $$
  where $\eta$ is the efficiency, $P_{\text{out}}$ is the output power, and $P_{\text{in}}$ is the input power.
  <br></br>

- **Torque Transmission**:
  $$
  T_2 = T_1 \cdot \text{Gear Ratio}
  $$
  where $T_1$ is the input torque and $T_2$ is the output torque.
