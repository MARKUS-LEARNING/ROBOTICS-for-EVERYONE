# Path Planning Algorithms

**Path Planning Algorithms** are computational methods used in robotics to determine the optimal path from a starting point to a destination. They are fundamental in enabling tasks such as autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, allowing robots to move efficiently and safely through their environment. Path planning algorithms consider factors such as the robot's dynamics, the environment's layout, and the presence of obstacles to compute the most effective route.

## Key Concepts

### Graph-Based Algorithms

Graph-based algorithms represent the environment as a graph, where nodes correspond to locations and edges represent the paths between them. Algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* use this representation to find the shortest path from the start to the goal.

### Sampling-Based Algorithms

Sampling-based algorithms, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM), explore the environment by randomly sampling points and connecting them to form a path. These algorithms are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and complex environments.

### Potential Field Methods

Potential field methods use artificial potential fields to guide the robot's path, where the goal attracts the robot and obstacles repel it. This approach is intuitive and can be combined with other methods to improve path planning.

### Optimization-Based Methods

Optimization-based methods formulate path planning as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a cost function that represents the path's length, smoothness, or other criteria. Techniques such as gradient descent and genetic algorithms are used to solve this problem.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph, using the following steps:

1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node: zero for the starting node and infinity for all other nodes.
2. Set the starting node as the current node.
3. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances.
4. When all the neighbors of the current node have been considered, mark the current node as visited.
5. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new current node, and repeat the process.

### A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal. The cost function for a node $n$ is given by:

$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

where:
- $f(n)$ is the total estimated cost of the path through node $n$.
- $g(n)$ is the cost from the start node to node $n$.
- $h(n)$ is the heuristic estimate of the cost from node $n$ to the goal.

### Example: Autonomous Navigation

Consider a mobile robot using the A* algorithm for autonomous navigation. The robot's environment is represented as a grid, where each cell corresponds to a location and edges represent the paths between them. The A* algorithm computes the shortest path from the robot's current position to the goal, considering the cost of moving through each cell and the heuristic estimate of the remaining distance. This enables the robot to navigate through the environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching its destination efficiently.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Enables robots to detect and avoid obstacles, performing tasks such as path planning and control.
- **Control Systems**: Path planning algorithms are used to design control algorithms that regulate the behavior of robotic systems, enabling precise and adaptive control.
- **Exploration**: Facilitates the exploration of unknown environments, enabling robots to map and navigate through new spaces.
