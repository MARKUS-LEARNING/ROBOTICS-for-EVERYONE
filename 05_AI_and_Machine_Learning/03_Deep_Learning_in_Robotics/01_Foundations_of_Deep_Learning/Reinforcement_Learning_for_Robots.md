# Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Robots

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a paradigm within [[Machine Learning]] where an agent (e.g., a robot) learns to achieve a goal in an environment by taking sequential actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled input-output pairs. Instead, the agent learns optimal behavior (a control [[Policy]]) through trial-and-error interaction, aiming to maximize its cumulative reward over time. RL is particularly relevant for robotics as it allows robots to acquire complex skills in situations where analytical models are difficult to derive or where adaptation to unknown environments is required.

## Core Concepts (Markov Decision Process - MDP)

RL problems are often formalized using the framework of a **[[Markov Decision Process (MDP)|Markov Decision Process]] (MDP)**, defined by:

* **Agent:** The robot acting as the learner and decision-maker.
* **Environment:** The physical world or simulation the robot interacts with.
* **State ($s$):** A representation of the situation at a given time (e.g., robot joint angles, velocities, object poses, sensor readings). Assumed to satisfy the Markov property (future state depends only on the current state and action, not past history).
* **Action ($a$):** A control command the agent can execute in a state (e.g., joint torque, motor velocity). Actions can be discrete or continuous.
* **Reward ($r$):** A scalar signal $r(s, a, s')$ received after taking action $a$ in state $s$ and transitioning to state $s'$. Indicates the immediate desirability of the transition. Designing effective reward functions is crucial but often challenging (reward shaping).
* **[[Policy]] ($\pi$):** The agent's learned strategy or controller, typically a mapping from states to actions ($\pi: s \mapsto a$). Can be deterministic or stochastic.
* **[[Value Function]]:** Estimates the expected long-term cumulative reward (often discounted over time):
    * **State-Value Function ($V^{\pi}(s)$):** Expected return starting from state $s$ and following policy $\pi$.
    * **Action-Value Function ($Q^{\pi}(s, a)$):** Expected return starting from state $s$, taking action $a$, and then following policy $\pi$.

The agent's goal is to find an optimal policy $\pi^*$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward (expected value).

## Learning Process

The core of RL involves the agent iteratively interacting with the environment:
1. Observe the current state $s$.
2. Select an action $a$ based on the current policy $\pi$.
3. Execute action $a$, transition to a new state $s'$, and receive reward $r$.
4. Update the policy $\pi$ and/or value function $V/Q$ based on the observed transition $(s, a, r, s')$.

A fundamental challenge in RL is the **exploration vs. exploitation** trade-off: the agent must balance exploiting its current knowledge to maximize immediate reward (taking actions believed to be good) with exploring new actions to potentially discover better strategies.

## [[Deep Learning|Deep]] Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

DRL combines RL with [[Deep Learning]], using [[Neural Networks in Control|deep neural networks]] as powerful function approximators for the policy and/or value functions. This allows RL to handle high-dimensional state spaces (e.g., raw camera images) and action spaces (e.g., continuous joint torques) and learn highly complex, nonlinear policies. DRL is the driving force behind many recent successes of RL in robotics.

## Common RL Algorithm Families

* **Value-Based Methods:** Learn an optimal action-value function $Q^*(s,a)$. The optimal policy is then implicitly defined by choosing the action that maximizes $Q^*(s,a)$ in any given state.
    * *Examples:* Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN - uses deep NNs for Q-function approximation, seminal work by Mnih et al.).
* **Policy-Based Methods:** Directly learn the parameters of the policy $\pi(a|s; \theta)$ without explicitly learning a value function. Often uses policy gradient methods to adjust parameters $\theta$ to increase expected reward.
    * *Examples:* REINFORCE, A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).
* **Actor-Critic Methods:** Combine aspects of value-based and policy-based methods. Learn both a policy (the "actor") and a value function (the "critic"). The critic evaluates the actions taken by the actor, providing feedback to improve the policy.
    * *Examples:* DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), SAC (Soft Actor-Critic).

## Applications in Robotics

RL and DRL are increasingly applied to challenging robotics problems:

* **[[Manipulation]]:** Learning dexterous grasping in clutter, complex assembly tasks, tool use, handling deformable objects. Seminal work by Levine et al. demonstrated DRL for complex manipulation skills learned end-to-end. Zeng et al. used DRL for learning pushing/grasping synergies.
* **[[Locomotion]]:** Learning dynamic walking gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal robots, agile flight control for drones.
* **[[Navigation]]:** Learning obstacle avoidance policies, adaptive path following, autonomous exploration strategies for mobile robots.
* **[[Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)|HRI]]:** Learning adaptive interaction behaviors based on human feedback or social cues.

## Challenges for RL in Robotics

Applying RL to real-world physical robots presents significant challenges compared to simulated domains or games:

* **Sample Efficiency:** RL algorithms often require millions of interaction samples to learn effectively. Collecting this much data on a physical robot is time-consuming, costly (wear and tear), and potentially dangerous.
* **Sim-to-Real Transfer:** Training policies in simulation is much faster and safer, but transferring these policies to the real world is difficult due to discrepancies between the simulation and reality (the "sim-to-real gap"). Techniques to bridge this gap include domain randomization, system identification, and domain adaptation.
* **Reward Function Design:** Specifying a reward function that correctly encodes the desired task and encourages efficient learning without leading to unexpected or unsafe "loopholes" is often non-trivial (reward shaping).
* **Safety and Stability:** Ensuring that the robot operates safely during the exploration phase of learning and that the final learned policy is stable and reliable is critical, especially for safety-critical applications. Formal verification of learned policies remains an open challenge.
* **High-Dimensional State/Action Spaces:** Robotics problems often involve continuous and high-dimensional state (e.g., sensor data) and action (e.g., joint torques) spaces, which pose challenges for many RL algorithms.
* **Partial Observability:** Real-world sensors provide noisy and incomplete state information, violating the full observability assumption of standard MDPs. Techniques for POMDPs or incorporating memory (e.g., using RNNs) are needed.

Despite these hurdles, RL offers a powerful paradigm for endowing robots with adaptive skills and behaviors learned directly from interaction, making it a central focus of current AI and robotics research.
