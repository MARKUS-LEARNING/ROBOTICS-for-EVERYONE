# Unsupervised Learning

**Unsupervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, enabling it to discover patterns and structures in the data. It is widely used in robotics for tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, where the model learns to identify inherent groupings or reduce the complexity of the data without prior knowledge of the output. Unsupervised learning is essential for exploring and understanding the underlying structure of data, facilitating tasks such as anomaly detection, feature extraction, and exploratory data analysis.

## Key Concepts

### Clustering

Clustering involves grouping data points into clusters based on their similarity. It is used in robotics for tasks such as object segmentation, where the model identifies distinct groups within the data, enabling the robot to recognize and interact with different objects in its environment.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction involves reducing the number of input variables in a dataset while retaining its essential structure. It is used in robotics for tasks such as feature extraction, where the model simplifies the data to improve computational efficiency and interpretability.

### Feature Learning

Feature learning involves automatically discovering the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. It is used in robotics for tasks such as pattern recognition, where the model learns to identify relevant features in the data.

### Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection involves identifying data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data. It is used in robotics for tasks such as fault detection, where the model recognizes unusual patterns that may indicate errors or malfunctions.

## Mathematical Formulation

### K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to partition a dataset into $k$ clusters. The objective is to minimize the within-cluster variance, given by:

$$
J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \| x - \mu_i \|^2
$$

where:
- $J$ is the objective function.
- $C_i$ is the $i$-th cluster.
- $\mu_i$ is the centroid of the $i$-th cluster.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of its variance. The transformation is defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data, given by:

$$
X' = X \cdot W
$$

where:
- $X$ is the original data matrix.
- $W$ is the matrix of eigenvectors.
- $X'$ is the transformed data matrix.

### Example: Object Segmentation

Consider a robotic system using unsupervised learning for object segmentation. The model uses clustering to group similar data points, identifying distinct objects within the environment. This enables the robot to recognize and interact with different objects, facilitating tasks such as grasping and manipulation.
