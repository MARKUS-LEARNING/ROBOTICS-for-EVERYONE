# Reinforcement Learning

**Reinforcement Learning** is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve a goal. It is widely used in robotics for tasks such as control and optimization, where the agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. Reinforcement learning enables robots to adapt and improve their behavior over time, making it a powerful tool for developing autonomous and adaptive systems.

## Key Concepts

### Agent and Environment

The agent is the learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment, which includes everything the agent interacts with. The agent takes actions that affect the environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

### Reward Function

The reward function defines the goal of the reinforcement learning task, providing feedback to the agent based on its actions. The agent's objective is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

### Policy

The policy defines the agent's behavior, mapping states of the environment to actions. The policy can be deterministic or stochastic, and it is what the agent learns to optimize through reinforcement learning.

### Value Function

The value function estimates the expected cumulative reward from a given state or state-action pair, guiding the agent's decision-making process. It is used to evaluate the desirability of states and actions.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Q-Learning

Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn the optimal action-selection policy for a given environment. The Q-value update equation is given by:

$$
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
$$

where:
- $Q(s, a)$ is the Q-value for state $s$ and action $a$.
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate.
- $r$ is the reward.
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor.
- $s'$ is the next state.
- $a'$ is the next action.

### Example: Robotic Control

Consider a robotic system using reinforcement learning for control. The robot learns to perform tasks such as navigation or manipulation by interacting with its environment. The Q-learning algorithm is used to update the Q-values based on the robot's actions and the received rewards, enabling the robot to adapt and improve its control strategy over time.
