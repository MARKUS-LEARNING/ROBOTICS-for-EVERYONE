# Semi-Supervised Learning

**Semi-Supervised Learning** is a machine learning approach that combines labeled and unlabeled data to train models. It leverages the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning to improve performance and generalization, making it particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Semi-supervised learning is widely used in robotics for tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering, where the model can benefit from the additional information provided by unlabeled data.

## Key Concepts

### Labeled and Unlabeled Data

Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled data, where the output is known, and unlabeled data, where the output is not provided. The model learns to make predictions based on the labeled data and discovers patterns and structures in the unlabeled data.

### Self-Training

Self-training is a semi-supervised learning technique where the model is initially trained on the labeled data and then used to predict labels for the unlabeled data. The most confident predictions are added to the labeled dataset, and the model is retrained iteratively.

### Co-Training

Co-training is a semi-supervised learning technique where multiple models are trained on different views or features of the data. Each model's predictions on the unlabeled data are used to augment the labeled dataset for the other models, improving the overall performance.

### Graph-Based Methods

Graph-based methods involve constructing a graph where nodes represent data points and edges represent their similarities. These methods use the graph structure to propagate labels from labeled to unlabeled data, leveraging the relationships between data points.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Self-Training Algorithm

The self-training algorithm can be represented as an iterative process:

1. Train the model on the labeled data $L$.
2. Use the model to predict labels for the unlabeled data $U$.
3. Select the most confident predictions and add them to $L$.
4. Retrain the model on the updated labeled dataset $L$.

### Co-Training Algorithm

The co-training algorithm involves two models $M_1$ and $M_2$ trained on different views of the data:

1. Train $M_1$ and $M_2$ on the labeled data $L$.
2. Use $M_1$ to predict labels for the unlabeled data $U$ and add the most confident predictions to $L$ for $M_2$.
3. Use $M_2$ to predict labels for the unlabeled data $U$ and add the most confident predictions to $L$ for $M_1$.
4. Retrain $M_1$ and $M_2$ on the updated labeled datasets.

### Example: Object Recognition

Consider a robotic system using semi-supervised learning for object recognition. The model is initially trained on a small labeled dataset of images, where each image is associated with a specific object category. The model then predicts labels for a larger unlabeled dataset, and the most confident predictions are added to the labeled dataset. The model is retrained iteratively, improving its ability to recognize and classify objects in the environment.
