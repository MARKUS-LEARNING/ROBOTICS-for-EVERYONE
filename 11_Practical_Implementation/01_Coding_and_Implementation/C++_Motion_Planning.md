# C++ Motion Planning

**C++ Motion Planning** refers to the development and implementation of algorithms using the C++ programming language to compute collision-free paths and trajectories for robots, such as [[Industrial_Arms|manipulator arms]] or [[Mobile_Robots]]. While motion planning concepts are language-agnostic, C++ is frequently chosen for implementation in robotics due to its performance characteristics, control over system resources, and prevalence in core robotics frameworks like [[ROS (Robot Operating System)]].

## Core Problem Revisited

The fundamental goal remains the same as described in [[Path Planning Algorithms]]: find a geometrically valid sequence of robot configurations (a *path*) from a start state to a goal state within the robot's [[ROBOTICS-for-EVERYONE/03_Kinematics_and_Dynamics/03_Trajectory_Planning/Configuration_Space]], while avoiding collisions with obstacles defined in the [[Workspace]]. Often, this path is then time-parameterized to create a smooth, executable *trajectory* specifying velocity and acceleration profiles ([[Trajectory_Planning]]). Both path and trajectory planning stages often leverage C++ implementations.

## Why C++ for Motion Planning?

While [[Python_ROS_Nodes|Python]] is widely used in robotics for scripting, high-level logic, and rapid prototyping, C++ is often preferred for computationally intensive tasks like motion planning due to:

* **Performance:** C++ generally offers significantly higher execution speed compared to interpreted languages like Python, which is critical for real-time collision checking, complex geometric computations, and implementing sophisticated planning algorithms (especially sampling-based methods on high-dimensional spaces).
* **Memory Management:** Provides fine-grained control over memory allocation and management, which can be important for resource-constrained robotic systems or large environment representations.
* **Real-Time Capabilities:** C++ is better suited for integration into real-time control loops where deterministic timing is essential.
* **Library Ecosystem:** Many core robotics libraries and middleware (including ROS/ROS 2 client libraries `roscpp`/`rclcpp`, [[PCL]], [[FCL]], [[OMPL]]) are written in or provide primary bindings for C++.
* **Hardware Integration:** C++ is often used for writing low-level hardware drivers and interfaces, making integration easier.

## Common C++ Libraries and Frameworks

Instead of implementing complex algorithms from scratch, developers typically leverage specialized C++ libraries:

* **[[OMPL]] (Open Motion Planning Library):** A powerful, open-source C++ library focused purely on motion planning. It provides state-of-the-art implementations of many sampling-based algorithms (PRM, RRT, RRT*, KPIECE, etc.) and interfaces for defining state spaces, state validity checkers (collision checking), and goal conditions. It is widely used both standalone and as a core planning engine within frameworks like MoveIt.
* **[[MoveIt]] (ROS/ROS 2):** A comprehensive open-source framework built on ROS/ROS 2, primarily in C++, specifically for [[Manipulation|manipulation]] tasks. MoveIt integrates:
    * **Planners:** Typically uses [[OMPL]] plugins for planning.
    * **[[Collision Detection]]:** Uses [[FCL]] for efficient collision checking against environment models (often OctoMaps built from sensor data).
    * **[[Kinematics]]:** Interfaces with [[Forward_Kinematics|forward]] and [[Inverse_Kinematics|inverse kinematics]] solvers.
    * **[[Perception]]:** Integrates with sensor processing nodes (e.g., to update collision environments).
    * **[[Trajectory_Planning]]:** Includes modules for post-processing paths into smooth, executable trajectories (e.g., TOTG, TOPP-RA).
    It provides [[Services]], [[Actions]], and [[RViz_Tutorial|RViz]] plugins for easy use within the ROS ecosystem.
* **[[FCL]] (Flexible Collision Library):** A dedicated C++ library providing fast and accurate collision detection algorithms for pairs of geometric models (meshes, basic shapes). It also supports distance queries. It's a dependency for many planning systems.
* **[[PCL]] (Point Cloud Library):** An extensive C++ library for processing 3D point cloud data obtained from sensors like [[LIDAR]] or depth cameras. Used extensively in the [[Perception]] pipeline to build environment representations (e.g., filtering, segmentation, registration, mesh generation) that serve as input to motion planners for collision checking.
* **SBPL (Search-Based Planning Library):** A C++ library focusing on heuristic search algorithms (like ARA*, AD*) for planning on discrete representations (grids or graphs), often used in mobile robot navigation.

## Implementation Aspects in C++

* **Representations:**
    * **Robot State/[[ROBOTICS-for-EVERYONE/03_Kinematics_and_Dynamics/03_Trajectory_Planning/Configuration_Space]]:** Often represented using standard C++ data structures (`std::vector<double>`) or specialized classes/structs, sometimes defined by the planning library (e.g., `ompl::base::State`).
    * **Environment:** Collision geometry often represented using FCL's internal structures or PCL point clouds. Occupancy grids might use multi-dimensional arrays or specialized libraries. Robot models parsed from [[URDF]]/SDF using libraries like `urdfdom` or ROS-specific parsers.
    * **Paths/Trajectories:** Represented as sequences (`std::vector`) of states or waypoints, potentially using library-specific classes (e.g., `moveit_msgs::RobotTrajectory`, `ompl::geometric::PathGeometric`).
* **Algorithms:** C++ implementations leverage efficiency through pointers, references, optimized loops, and efficient data structures (e.g., k-d trees from FLANN or nanoflann for nearest-neighbor searches in sampling-based planners). Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles help structure complex planning algorithms and state representations.
* **[[ROS (Robot Operating System)|ROS]] Integration:**
    * C++ nodes (`rclcpp`/`roscpp`) encapsulate planning functionality.
    * Planning requests are often handled via ROS [[Services]] (for simpler path requests) or [[Actions]] (for complex planning with feedback, like in MoveIt's `/move_group` action).
    * Nodes subscribe to [[Topics]] carrying sensor data (`sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`, `sensor_msgs/JointState`), goal specifications (`geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`), or map updates (`nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid`).
    * Planned paths or trajectories are published on [[Topics]] (e.g., `moveit_msgs/DisplayTrajectory`, `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory`) for execution by controllers or visualization in [[RViz_Tutorial|RViz]].
    * [[TF_and_Topic_Architecture|TF]] library (`tf2_ros`) is used extensively for coordinate transformations between sensor frames, robot frames, and world frames.

## Typical C++ Motion Planning Workflow

1.  **Problem Definition:** Load robot model ([[URDF]]), define environment geometry (from sensors/CAD, often using [[PCL]], [[FCL]]), specify start and goal configurations/poses.
2.  **Planner Setup:** Instantiate planner object (e.g., `ompl::geometric::RRTConnect`), configure parameters (planning time, range, goal bias), set up state space and validity checker (using [[FCL]] for collision checks). If using MoveIt, configure via ROS parameters and launch files.
3.  **Planning:** Call the planner's `solve()` or equivalent function.
4.  **Path Retrieval & Smoothing:** Extract the resulting geometric path. Often apply post-processing/smoothing algorithms.
5.  **[[Trajectory_Planning|Trajectory Generation]]:** Time-parameterize the path considering velocity/acceleration limits to create an executable trajectory (e.g., using MoveIt's trajectory processing).
6.  **Execution:** Send the trajectory (often as joint commands over ROS [[Topics]] or [[Actions]]) to the robot's low-level controllers.

C++ remains a cornerstone for implementing performance-critical motion planning algorithms and integrating them effectively within robotics systems, particularly when using frameworks like ROS/ROS 2.
