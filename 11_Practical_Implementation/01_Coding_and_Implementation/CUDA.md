## Mathematical Formulation

### Parallel Algorithm

A parallel algorithm in CUDA can be represented as a function that performs computations on multiple processors simultaneously, enabling the execution of tasks in parallel. The parallel computation $C$ can be represented as:

$$
C = \{c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n\}
$$

where:
- $C$ is the parallel computation.
- $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n$ are the computations performed on each processor.

### Example: Real-Time Processing

Consider a robotic system using CUDA for real-time processing. The system's sensors provide data about its environment, such as the presence of obstacles and the layout of the space. The parallel algorithm processes this data in real-time to determine the robot's actions, such as moving forward or turning, enabling it to navigate through the environment and reach its destination effectively. The CUDA code for real-time processing can be represented as:

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// CUDA kernel for real-time processing
__global__ void processSensorData(float* sensorData, float* controlSignal, int size) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < size) {
        controlSignal[idx] = sensorData[idx] * 0.1;
    }
}

int main() {
    const int size = 10;
    float sensorData[size] = {10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0, 100.0};
    float controlSignal[size];

    float *d_sensorData, *d_controlSignal;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_sensorData, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_controlSignal, size * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_sensorData, sensorData, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    processSensorData<<<1, size>>>(d_sensorData, d_controlSignal, size);

    cudaMemcpy(controlSignal, d_controlSignal, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("Control Signal: %f\n", controlSignal[i]);
    }

    cudaFree(d_sensorData);
    cudaFree(d_controlSignal);

    return 0;
}
```
