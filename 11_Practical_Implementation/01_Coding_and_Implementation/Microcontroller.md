# Microcontroller

**Microcontroller** is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It combines a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals on a single chip, making it ideal for controlling various devices and processes in real-time applications.

## Key Components of Microcontrollers

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The core of the microcontroller that executes instructions and performs calculations.
   <br>

2. **Memory**: Includes both volatile (RAM) and non-volatile (ROM, Flash) memory for storing data and program instructions.
   <br>

3. **Input/Output Ports (I/O Ports)**: Interfaces for connecting the microcontroller to external devices such as sensors, actuators, and communication modules.
   <br>

4. **Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC)**: Convert analog signals from sensors into digital values that the microcontroller can process.
   <br>

5. **Timers and Counters**: Used for generating precise time delays, measuring time intervals, and counting events.
   <br>

6. **Communication Interfaces**: Protocols such as UART, SPI, I2C, and USB for communicating with other devices and systems.
   <br>

7. **Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)**: A technique for controlling the power delivered to devices such as motors and LEDs by varying the width of pulses.

## Mathematical Representations

### Analog-to-Digital Conversion

Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) is a crucial function in microcontrollers for interfacing with analog sensors. The resolution of an ADC is determined by the number of bits it uses to represent the analog signal. The voltage resolution $V_{res}$ can be calculated as:

$$
V_{res} = \frac{V_{ref}}{2^n}
$$

where $V_{ref}$ is the reference voltage and $n$ is the number of bits.

### Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)

Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is used to control the average power delivered to a load. The duty cycle $D$ is the ratio of the pulse width $t_{on}$ to the period $T$:

$$
D = \frac{t_{on}}{T}
$$

The average voltage $V_{avg}$ delivered to the load is given by:

$$
V_{avg} = D \cdot V_{supply}
$$

where $V_{supply}$ is the supply voltage.

### Timer Calculations

Timers are used to generate precise time delays and measure time intervals. The frequency $f$ of a timer is determined by the clock frequency $f_{clk}$ and the prescaler value $P$:

$$
f = \frac{f_{clk}}{P}
$$

The time period $T$ of the timer is the inverse of the frequency:

$$
T = \frac{1}{f}
$$
