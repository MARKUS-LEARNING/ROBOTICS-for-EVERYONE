# Arduino

**Arduino** is an open-source electronics platform used for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices. It is widely used in robotics for prototyping and developing embedded control systems. Arduino boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that can be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits. The platform is based on easy-to-use hardware and software, making it accessible for beginners and useful for a wide range of applications.

## Key Concepts

### Microcontrollers

Arduino boards are based on microcontrollers, which are compact integrated circuits designed to govern specific operations in embedded systems. They are the core components that execute the programmed instructions to control robotic systems.

### Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed to perform dedicated functions within larger systems. Arduino is a key tool in developing embedded systems for robotics, enabling the integration of sensors, actuators, and communication modules.

### Sensor Integration

Arduino supports the integration of various sensors, such as temperature, motion, and proximity sensors, allowing robots to interact with their environment by collecting and processing data.

### Control Systems

Arduino is used to implement control algorithms that regulate the behavior of robotic systems. It provides the computational power and interfacing capabilities required to execute control strategies.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Analog to Digital Conversion

Arduino boards can read analog signals and convert them to digital values using Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC). The conversion process can be represented as:

$$
V_{digital} = \frac{V_{analog} \times 1023}{V_{ref}}
$$

where:
- $V_{digital}$ is the digital value.
- $V_{analog}$ is the analog voltage.
- $V_{ref}$ is the reference voltage (usually 5V or 3.3V).

### Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

PWM is a technique used to control the power supplied to electronic devices, such as motors. The duty cycle $D$ of a PWM signal is given by:

$$
D = \frac{t_{on}}{T}
$$

where:
- $t_{on}$ is the time the signal is high.
- $T$ is the total period of the signal.

### Example: Motor Control

Consider a robotic system using an Arduino to control a DC motor. The motor's speed can be regulated using PWM, where the duty cycle determines the average voltage applied to the motor. By adjusting the duty cycle, the Arduino can control the motor's speed and direction, enabling precise motion control.
