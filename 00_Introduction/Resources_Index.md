## Notes Referencing This Index

This Dataview query shows which notes in your vault link back to this `Resources_Index` page, helping you trace how resources are used. Ensure notes reference this page in their `related:` frontmatter field (e.g., `related: ["[[Resources_Index]]"]`).

```
dataview
TABLE related AS "Related Fields Containing Link"
FROM "" 
WHERE contains(file.outlinks, this.file.link) OR contains(related, this.file.name)
SORT file.name ASC
```
