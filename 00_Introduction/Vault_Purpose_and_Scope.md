# Vault Purpose and Scope

This vault is a **living knowledge system** for understanding, exploring, and documenting the field of **modern robotics**, with an emphasis on:

- **Foundational principles** in mechanics, control, and motion
- **Current applications** across industries and disciplines
- **Intelligent systems and AI integration**
- **Emerging trends and future technologies**

---

## üåç Vision

To become a lifelong reference and creative lab for building and applying robotics knowledge ‚Äî spanning research, development, experimentation, and speculation.

---

## Scope

This vault is organized around the **core components of robotics**, including:

- **Kinematics & Dynamics**: [[Forward_Kinematics]], [[Inverse_Kinematics]], [[Trajectory_Planning]], [[Torque_and_Force_Calculations]]
- **Sensors & Perception**: [[LIDAR]], [[Camera_Systems]], [[IMU_Sensors]], [[Sensor_Fusion]]
- **AI & Control Systems**: [[Reinforcement_Learning_for_Robots]], [[Computer_Vision_in_Robotics]], [[Path_Planning_Algorithms]], [[Neural_Networks_in_Control]]
- **Robotic Frameworks**: [[ROS_2_Overview]], [[Gazebo_Simulator]], [[TF_and_Topic_Architecture]], [[Custom_Packages_and_Nodes]]
- **Robot Types**: [[Humanoid_Robots]], [[Mobile_Robots]], [[Industrial_Arms]], [[Swarm_Robots]]
- **History & Ethics**: [[History_of_Robotics]], [[Robot_Ethics_and_Policy_Debates]], [[Future_Trends_2025-2035]]
- **Code & Prototypes**: [[Python_ROS_Nodes]], [[C++_Motion_Planning]], [[Hardware_Interface_Setup]], [[Sim2Real_Experiments]]
- **Tools & Learning Resources**: [[MOOCs_and_Courses]], [[Research_Papers_Index]], [[Simulators_and_IDEs]], [[Hardware_Shopping_List]]
