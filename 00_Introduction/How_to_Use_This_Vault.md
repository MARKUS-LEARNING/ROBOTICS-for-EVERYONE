# How to Use This Vault

Welcome to your **Robotics Obsidian Vault**! This guide explains how to navigate its structure, contribute effectively, and leverage its features to create a powerful personal knowledge base on robotics.

---

## Section 1: Understanding the Structure

This vault organizes knowledge into core thematic folders, detailed in the [[Vault_Taxonomy_Guide]]. Key areas include:

- **`00_Introduction`**: An overview of the field of robotics, its significance, and the scope of the course.
- **`01_Fundamentals_of_Robotics`**: Definitions of fundamental robotics terms.
- **`02_Mathematics_for_Robotics`**: The mathematics of robot motion and forces.
- **`03_Kinematics_and_Dynamics`**: How robots sense and interpret their environment.
- **`04_Sensors_and_Perception`**: Autonomy, machine learning, and control strategies.
- **`05_AI_and_Machine_Learning`**: Overview of [[ROS_2_Overview]] and related tools like [[Gazebo_Simulator]].
- **`06_Robot_Control`**: Profiles of [[Industrial_Arms]], [[Mobile_Robots]], [[Humanoid_Robots]], etc.
- **`07_Robot_Operating_System_(ROS)`**: Timelines [[History_of_Robotics]], [[Future_Trends_2025-2035]], and [[Robot_Ethics_and_Policy_Debates]].
- **`08_Robot_Types_and_Applications`**: Examples and applications of [[Python_ROS_Nodes]], [[C++_Motion_Planning]], and practical examples.
- **`09_Advanced_Topics`**: Hands-on work like [[Turtlesim_Projects]] and [[Sim2Real_Experiments]].
- **`10_Research_and_Development`**: External resources including [[MOOCs_and_Courses]], [[Research_Papers_Index]], [[Simulators_and_IDEs]].
- **`11_Practical_Implementation`**: External resources including [[MOOCs_and_Courses]], [[Research_Papers_Index]], [[Simulators_and_IDEs]].
- **`12_Labs_and_Tutorials`**: External resources including [[MOOCs_and_Courses]], [[Research_Papers_Index]], [[Simulators_and_IDEs]].
- **`13_Tools_References_and_Links`**: External resources including [[MOOCs_and_Courses]], [[Research_Papers_Index]], [[Simulators_and_IDEs]].

Refer to the [[Vault_Taxonomy_Guide]] for detailed folder descriptions and tagging strategies.

## Section 2: Navigating with the Dashboard

The [[Robotics_Vault_Dashboard]] provides a dynamic overview of your notes, categorized by topic.

**Requirement:** This dashboard relies on the **Dataview** community plugin.
* **To Install/Enable:** Go to Obsidian `Settings` -> `Community Plugins` -> `Browse`, search for "Dataview", install it, and then enable it.

---

## Section 3: Adding and Editing Content

Consistency is key for a useful vault. When creating or modifying notes:

1.  **Placement:** Create new notes within the relevant numbered folder (e.g., a note on Kalman Filters would go in `03_Sensors_and_Perception`).
2.  **Frontmatter:** Copy the YAML frontmatter (the section between `---` at the top) from an existing note and update the `title`, `description`, `tags`, and `related` fields. Use relevant tags (see [[Vault_Taxonomy_Guide]]).
3.  **Content:** Populate the note body with clear explanations, definitions, equations (using LaTeX `$ $` or `$$ $$`), code snippets (using ``` ``` blocks), diagrams, images, and references.
4.  **Linking:** Use `[[Internal Links]]` generously to connect related concepts across different notes. Link to glossary terms, foundational concepts, specific examples, or related tools.

---

## ``Section 4: Maintaining the Vault

Treat this vault as a *living document*:

-   **Log Changes:** Record significant updates or structural changes in the [[Version_History_Log]].
-   **Track the Future:** Add new research, predictions, or industry news to [[Future_Trends_2025-2035]].
-   **Document Practice:** Add your notes, logs, and results from experiments or tutorials under `09_Labs_Projects_and_Tutorials/`.

---

## Section 5: Enhancing Your Experience (Optional)

Consider these powerful Obsidian plugins to further augment your vault:

-   **[[Obsidian Canvas|Canvas]]**: Create visual connections, mind maps, or system diagrams linking your notes.
-   **[[Excalidraw]]**: Sketch diagrams (like kinematic chains or control loops) directly within or linked to your notes.
-   **DataviewJS**: For users comfortable with JavaScript, unlock advanced querying, custom views, and dynamic visualizations beyond standard Dataview.
