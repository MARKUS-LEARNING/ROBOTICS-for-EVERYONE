## Section 1: Understanding the Structure

This vault organizes knowledge into core thematic folders, detailed in the [[Vault_Taxonomy_Guide]]. Key areas include:


    00_Introduction: An overview of the field of robotics, its significance, and the scope of the course.
    01_Fundamentals_of_Robotics: Definitions of fundamental robotics terms.
    02_Mathematics_for_Robotics: The mathematics of robot motion and forces.
    03_Kinematics_and_Dynamics: Study of motion and forces in robotic systems.
    04_Sensors_and_Perception: How robots sense and interpret their environment.
    05_AI_and_Machine_Learning: Autonomy, machine learning, and control strategies.
    06_Robot_Control: Techniques and algorithms for controlling robotic systems.
    07_Robot_Operating_System_(ROS): Overview of ROS 2 and related tools like Gazebo Simulator.
    08_Robot_Types_and_Applications: Profiles of Industrial Arms, Mobile Robots, Humanoid Robots, etc.
    09_Advanced_Topics: Future trends and robot ethics and policy debates.
    10_Research_and_Development: Examples and applications of Python ROS Nodes, C++ Motion Planning, and practical examples.
    11_Practical_Implementation: Hands-on work like Turtlesim Projects and Sim2Real Experiments.
    12_Labs_and_Tutorials: External resources including MOOCs and Courses, Research Papers Index, Simulators, and IDEs.
    13_Tools_References_and_Links: External resources including MOOCs and Courses, Research Papers Index, Simulators, and IDEs.


Refer to the [[Vault_Taxonomy_Guide]] for detailed folder descriptions and tagging strategies.

## Section 2: Navigating with the Dashboard

The [[Robotics_Vault_Dashboard]] provides a dynamic overview of your notes, categorized by topic.

**Requirement:** This dashboard relies on the **Dataview** community plugin.
* **To Install/Enable:** Go to Obsidian `Settings` -> `Community Plugins` -> `Browse`, search for "Dataview", install it, and then enable it.

---

## Section 3: Adding and Editing Content

Consistency is key for a useful vault. When creating or modifying notes:

1.  **Placement:** Create new notes within the relevant numbered folder (e.g., a note on Kalman Filters would go in `03_Sensors_and_Perception`).
2.  **Frontmatter:** Copy the YAML frontmatter (the section between `---` at the top) from an existing note and update the `title`, `description`, `tags`, and `related` fields. Use relevant tags (see [[Vault_Taxonomy_Guide]]).
3.  **Content:** Populate the note body with clear explanations, definitions, equations (using LaTeX `$ $` or `$$ $$`), code snippets (using ``` ``` blocks), diagrams, images, and references.
4.  **Linking:** Use `[[Internal Links]]` generously to connect related concepts across different notes. Link to glossary terms, foundational concepts, specific examples, or related tools.

---

## ``Section 4: Maintaining the Vault

Treat this vault as a *living document*:

-   **Log Changes:** Record significant updates or structural changes in the [[Version_History_Log]].
-   **Track the Future:** Add new research, predictions, or industry news to [[Future_Trends_2025-2035]].
-   **Document Practice:** Add your notes, logs, and results from experiments or tutorials under `09_Labs_Projects_and_Tutorials/`.

---

## Section 5: Enhancing Your Experience (Optional)

Consider these powerful Obsidian plugins to further augment your vault:

-   **[[Obsidian Canvas|Canvas]]**: Create visual connections, mind maps, or system diagrams linking your notes.
-   **[[Excalidraw]]**: Sketch diagrams (like kinematic chains or control loops) directly within or linked to your notes.
-   **DataviewJS**: For users comfortable with JavaScript, unlock advanced querying, custom views, and dynamic visualizations beyond standard Dataview.
