## METHODS

The ROBOTICS-for-PEOPLE project, developed under the MIT License, ensures open access and encourages community contributions. Initially built as an educational tool for myself, it has evolved into a project I am eager to share with everyone. The intention is to help others learn alongside as the field of robotics expands rapidly. Central to this initiative is an AI agent built in Mistral, which leverages an extensive dataset comprising top robotics textbooks, research papers, and in-depth research conducted by advanced AI models such as Gemini 2.5, ChatGPT, and Claude. These tools are utilized to cross-reference content, validate equations, and lint code for syntax accuracy. This robust framework not only ensures the precision and relevance of the material but also presents a unique opportunity for community contributions. As the field of robotics continues to evolve, this collaborative approach allows for the continuous improvement, expansion, and refinement of the textbook content.
