# Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)

**Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)** are miniaturized devices that integrate mechanical and electrical components on a common silicon substrate, typically ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers in size. These devices are fabricated using techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor industry, allowing for precise control over their dimensions and properties. MEMS are widely used in robotics for creating compact, efficient, and highly functional sensors and actuators.

## Key Equations

### Capacitive Sensor Principle

The capacitance $C$ of a capacitive sensor is given by:

$$
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r A}{d}
$$

where:
- $C$ is the capacitance.
- $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
- $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the material.
- $A$ is the area of the capacitor plates.
- $d$ is the distance between the plates.

### Resonant Frequency of a MEMS Oscillator

The resonant frequency $f_0$ of a MEMS oscillator is calculated as:

$$
f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
$$

where:
- $f_0$ is the resonant frequency.
- $k$ is the spring constant.
- $m$ is the mass of the oscillating structure.

### Piezoresistive Effect

The change in resistance $\Delta R$ due to the piezoresistive effect is given by:

$$
\Delta R = G \cdot \epsilon \cdot R
$$

where:
- $\Delta R$ is the change in resistance.
- $G$ is the gauge factor.
- $\epsilon$ is the strain.
- $R$ is the original resistance.
