## Key Equations

### Diffusion of Nanorobots

The diffusion of nanorobots through a medium can be described by:

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C
$$

where:
- $C$ is the concentration of nanorobots.
- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.
- $t$ is time.

This equation describes how nanorobots diffuse through a medium over time.

### Magnetic Control

The force $F$ acting on a nanorobot under magnetic control is given by:

$$
F = \nabla (\vec{m} \cdot \vec{B})
$$

where:
- $F$ is the force acting on the nanorobot.
- $\vec{m}$ is the magnetic moment of the nanorobot.
- $\vec{B}$ is the external magnetic field.

### Drug Delivery Efficiency

The efficiency $\eta$ of drug delivery by nanorobots is calculated as:

$$
\eta = \frac{Q_d}{Q_t}
$$

where:
- $\eta$ is the efficiency of drug delivery.
- $Q_d$ is the quantity of drug delivered to the target site.
- $Q_t$ is the total quantity of drug administered.
