## Key Equations

### Surface Area to Volume Ratio

The surface area to volume ratio of a spherical nanoparticle is given by:

$$
\frac{A}{V} = \frac{6}{d}
$$

where:
- $A$ is the surface area.
- $V$ is the volume.
- $d$ is the diameter of the nanoparticle.

This ratio is critical in understanding the unique properties of nanomaterials, as it influences their reactivity and interaction with other substances.

### Quantum Confinement

The energy levels in nanoscale structures due to quantum confinement are described by:

$$
E = \frac{h^2 n^2}{8mL^2}
$$

where:
- $E$ is the energy level.
- $h$ is Planck's constant.
- $n$ is the quantum number.
- $m$ is the mass of the particle.
- $L$ is the confinement length.

This equation describes how energy levels change in nanoscale structures due to quantum effects.

### Nanoparticle Concentration

The concentration $C$ of nanoparticles in a solution is given by:

$$
C = \frac{N}{V}
$$

where:
- $C$ is the concentration.
- $N$ is the number of nanoparticles.
- $V$ is the volume of the solution.

This equation is used to determine the density of nanoparticles in a given medium.
