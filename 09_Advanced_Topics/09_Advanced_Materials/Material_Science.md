## Types of Materials

Materials can be categorized based on their composition and properties:

* **Metals**: Known for their high strength, conductivity, and ductility. Commonly used in structural applications, electronics, and machinery. Examples include steel, aluminum, and copper.
  <br>

* **Ceramics**: Hard, brittle materials with high melting points, often used in applications requiring resistance to heat and wear. Examples include glass, alumina, and silicon carbide.
  <br>

* **Polymers**: Lightweight, flexible materials composed of long chains of molecules. Used in a wide range of applications, from plastics to advanced composites. Examples include polyethylene, polycarbonate, and Kevlar.
  <br>

* **Composites**: Materials made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties. Composites combine the best properties of their constituents, such as strength and light weight. Examples include fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforced polymers.
  <br>

* **Semiconductors**: Materials with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator. Used in electronics and optoelectronics. Examples include silicon and gallium arsenide.
  <br>

* **Biomaterials**: Materials designed to interact with biological systems for medical applications. Examples include titanium for implants and hydrogels for tissue engineering.

## Mathematical Representations

### Stress-Strain Relationship

The mechanical behavior of materials under load can be described by the stress-strain relationship:

$$
\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon
$$

where $\sigma$ is the stress, $E$ is the Young's modulus (a measure of stiffness), and $\epsilon$ is the strain (deformation relative to original dimensions).

### Thermal Expansion

The change in dimensions of a material due to temperature changes can be described by the coefficient of thermal expansion $\alpha$:

$$
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L_0 \cdot \Delta T
$$

where $\Delta L$ is the change in length, $L_0$ is the original length, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

### Electrical Conductivity

The ability of a material to conduct electricity is described by its electrical conductivity $\sigma$:

$$
J = \sigma \cdot E
$$

where $J$ is the current density and $E$ is the electric field strength.

### Diffusion

The movement of atoms or molecules within a material can be described by Fick's first law of diffusion:

$$
J = -D \cdot \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}
$$

where $J$ is the diffusion flux, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}$ is the concentration gradient.
