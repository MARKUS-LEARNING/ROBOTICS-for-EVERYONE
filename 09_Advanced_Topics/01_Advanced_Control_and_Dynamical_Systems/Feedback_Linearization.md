# Feedback Linearization

**Feedback Linearization** is a control technique used to transform nonlinear systems into equivalent linear systems through state feedback, enabling the application of linear control methods. This technique is particularly useful in robotics, where many systems exhibit nonlinear dynamics. By linearizing the system, traditional linear control strategies, such as [[PID_Control|PID Control]], can be effectively applied to achieve desired performance and stability.

## Key Concepts

### Nonlinear Systems

Nonlinear systems are characterized by dynamics that cannot be described by linear equations. These systems often exhibit complex behaviors such as limit cycles, chaos, and multiple equilibrium points. Feedback linearization provides a method to handle these nonlinearities by transforming the system into a linear form.

### State Feedback

State feedback involves using the system's state variables to compute the control input. In feedback linearization, state feedback is used to cancel out the nonlinear terms in the system dynamics, resulting in a linear system.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Nonlinear System Representation

Consider a nonlinear system described by:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}) + g(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{u}
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the state vector.
- $\mathbf{u}$ is the control input vector.
- $f(\mathbf{x})$ and $g(\mathbf{x})$ are nonlinear functions representing the system dynamics.

### Feedback Linearization

The goal of feedback linearization is to find a control law $\mathbf{u}$ such that the closed-loop system is linear. This is achieved by designing a state feedback control law of the form:

$$
\mathbf{u} = \alpha(\mathbf{x}) + \beta(\mathbf{x}) \mathbf{v}
$$

where:
- $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$ is a function that cancels the nonlinear terms in $f(\mathbf{x})$.
- $\beta(\mathbf{x})$ is a function that ensures the system is linear with respect to the new input $\mathbf{v}$.

The resulting linear system is:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = A \mathbf{x} + B \mathbf{v}
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are constant matrices.
