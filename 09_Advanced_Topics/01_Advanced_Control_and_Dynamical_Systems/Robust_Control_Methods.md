# Robust Control Methods

**Robust Control Methods** are designed to ensure stability and performance of control systems in the presence of uncertainties, disturbances, and model inaccuracies. These methods are crucial in robotics, where systems often operate in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Robust control aims to maintain system performance and stability despite variations in system parameters and external influences.

## Key Concepts

### Uncertainty and Disturbances

Robust control addresses uncertainties and disturbances that can affect the performance and stability of control systems. These include:
- **Model Uncertainties**: Inaccuracies or variations in the system model.
- **External Disturbances**: Unpredictable inputs or changes in the operating environment.
- **Parameter Variations**: Changes in system parameters over time or due to wear and tear.

### Stability and Performance

Robust control methods focus on ensuring that the control system remains stable and performs well under adverse conditions. This involves designing controllers that can handle a range of uncertainties and disturbances while maintaining desired performance criteria.

## Mathematical Formulation

### H-infinity Control

H-infinity control is a robust control method that minimizes the worst-case gain from disturbances to the system output. It ensures that the system remains stable and performs well even in the presence of significant uncertainties and disturbances.

- **Mathematical Representation**:
  The H-infinity norm of a transfer function $G(s)$ is given by:
  $$
  \|G(s)\|_\infty = \sup_{\omega} |G(j\omega)|
  $$
  The goal of H-infinity control is to design a controller that minimizes this norm, ensuring robust stability and performance.

### Sliding Mode Control

Sliding mode control is a nonlinear control strategy that forces the system states to slide along a predefined surface, providing robustness to model uncertainties and external disturbances.

- **Mathematical Representation**:
  The control law is designed to drive the system states to a sliding surface $s(\mathbf{x}) = 0$:
  $$
  \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u}_{eq} - K \cdot \text{sign}(s(\mathbf{x}))
  $$
  where $\mathbf{u}_{eq}$ is the equivalent control, and $K$ is the control gain.

### Lyapunov-Based Methods

Lyapunov-based methods use Lyapunov functions to analyze and ensure the stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of uncertainties.

- **Lyapunov Function**:
  $$
  V(\mathbf{x}) > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \dot{V}(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0
  $$
  where $V(\mathbf{x})$ is a positive definite function, and $\dot{V}(\mathbf{x})$ is its time derivative.
