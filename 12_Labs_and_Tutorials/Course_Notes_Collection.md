# Course Notes Collection

This note serves as a central hub and organizational guide for your personal notes derived from various robotics learning resources, including:

* Online courses (from [[MOOCs_and_Courses]])
* Textbooks (listed in [[Resources_Index]])
* Tutorials (like ROS Tutorials or software documentation)
* Workshops or conference materials

The goal is to structure your learning notes effectively within this vault, making them discoverable and connectable to other concepts.

## Organization Strategies

Choose a strategy that best suits your learning style:

1.  **By Source:**
    * Create a dedicated note or subfolder within `09_Labs_Projects_and_Tutorials` for each major course, textbook, or tutorial series (e.g., `[[Coursera Robotics Specialization Notes]]`, `[[Craig Textbook Notes]]`).
    * This `Course_Notes_Collection.md` note acts as the master index, linking to each of these primary source notes.
    * Use tags and links *within* those notes to connect specific concepts back to the main vault structure (e.g., link a discussion on inverse kinematics in your course notes to the main [[Inverse_Kinematics]] note).

2.  **By Topic (Integrated Approach):**
    * Create notes primarily based on topics, placing them in the relevant subject folders (e.g., `02_Kinematics_and_Dynamics`, `04_AI_and_Robot_Control`).
    * Within each note, use frontmatter metadata or inline tags to indicate the source(s) where you learned about that concept (e.g., `source: [[Coursera Robotics Specialization Notes]]`, `tags: #course-notes #control-theory`).
    * This approach emphasizes building the knowledge graph directly but might make it harder to review notes from a single course sequentially.

3.  **Hybrid Approach:**
    * Create main pages for major courses/books (Strategy 1).
    * For specific concepts learned, create separate notes in the relevant topic folders (Strategy 2).
    * Heavily link between the course notes and the topic notes using Obsidian's `[[ ]]` links and `#tags`. This often provides the best balance between structured learning and conceptual connection.

## Suggested Structure for Course/Source Notes

When creating a dedicated note for a specific course or book (e.g., `[[My Robotics Course Notes]]`), consider using a structure like this:

```markdown
---
title: My Robotics Course Notes 
description: Notes from [Course Name] by [Instructor/Provider].
tags: [course-notes, kinematics, perception] # Add relevant topic tags
course: "[Course Name]" # Frontmatter field for Dataview
provider: "[e.g., Coursera, edX, University Name]"
url: "[Link to course]"
status: "[e.g., In Progress, Completed]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD 
related: ["[[Course_Notes_Collection]]"]
---

# Notes: [Course Name]

**Link:** [Provider URL]([Link to course])
**Status:** [e.g., Completed]

## Overview / Syllabus

* Brief summary of course topics.
* Link to official syllabus if available.

## Modules / Lectures

* [[My Robotics Course - Module 1 Notes]]
* [[My Robotics Course - Module 2 Notes]]
    * [[My Robotics Course - Lecture 2.1 Notes]]
* ... *(Link to sub-notes for each module or lecture)*

## Key Concepts Covered

* [[Concept 1]] learned in this course
* [[Concept 2]] - See Module 3 notes
* ... *(Link to main vault notes for key concepts)*

## Related Labs/Projects

* [[My Project Based on Course X]]
* [[Lab 1 Solution Notes]]
* ... *(Link to related project/lab notes in this folder)*

## General Takeaways / Reflections

* Your summary thoughts.
```

## Linking and Tagging Strategy

- **Link Concepts:** When taking notes on a specific concept (e.g., PID control within a course lecture), create a link to your main vault note on that concept: `[[PID_Control]]`. This builds connections automatically.
- **Use Tags:** Tag individual course note pages or sections with relevant topic tags (e.g., `#control-theory`, `#ROS`, `#python`, `#perception`) in addition to a general `#course-notes` tag.
- **Link Back:** Ensure individual course notes link back to this collection page `[[Course_Notes_Collection]]`.

## Dynamic Overview with Dataview

You can use the [[Dataview]] plugin to automatically generate lists of your course notes here. Add a code block like the following to dynamically list all notes you've marked as course notes (either via tag or frontmatter):

Code snippet

TABLE course AS "Course/Source", provider AS "Provider", status AS "Status", file.cday AS "Date Created"
FROM "09_Labs_Projects_and_Tutorials" OR "" 
WHERE contains(file.tags, "#course-notes") OR course
SORT course ASC, file.name ASC
