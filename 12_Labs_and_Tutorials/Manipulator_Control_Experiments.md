# Manipulator Control Experiments

This note serves as a central collection point and organizational template for documenting practical experiments conducted on controlling [[Manipulator_Arm_Types|robotic manipulator arms]]. Implementing and testing control algorithms, whether in simulation or on physical hardware, is crucial for gaining a deep understanding of [[Control Theory|control theory]], robot [[Dynamics]], [[Kinematics]], and the challenges of real-world implementation.

## Experiment Documentation Structure

It's highly recommended to document each experiment thoroughly for reproducibility and learning. Consider creating separate notes for each significant experiment and linking them here, or use headings within this document. A suggested structure for documenting each experiment is:

### Experiment: [Descriptive Title - e.g., PID Joint Position Control Tuning for UR5 Joint 2]

* **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
* **Objective:** Clearly state the goal(s) of the experiment. (e.g., To implement and tune PID gains for joint 2 of a simulated UR5 arm to achieve a critically damped response to a step input, minimizing overshoot and settling time. To compare performance with different gain values.)
* **Theoretical Background:** Briefly mention the control concepts being tested. Link to relevant vault notes (e.g., `[[PID_Control]]`, `[[Joint Space]] Control`).
* **Setup:**
    * **Robot Model:** Specify the manipulator used (e.g., Simulated Franka Emika Panda in [[Gazebo_Simulator]], physical [[Arduino]]-based SCARA arm). Link to its [[URDF]] or description `[[My_Robot_Description]]`.
    * **Software:** List the key software components ([[ROS (Robot Operating System)|ROS]] version, [[MoveIt]], [[OMPL]], specific [[Python_ROS_Nodes|Python]]/[[C++_Motion_Planning|C++]] code packages, [[MATLAB]]/Simulink). Link to relevant code repositories using [[Git_Integration_and_Version_Control]].
    * **Control Algorithm:** Detail the specific algorithm implemented (e.g., Independent Joint PID, [[Computed Torque Control]], Resolved Motion Rate Control).
    * **Environment:** Describe the experimental environment (e.g., [[Gazebo_Simulator]] world file, physical setup description).
* **Procedure:**
    * Provide step-by-step instructions on how to replicate the experiment.
    * Include configuration details, parameters used (e.g., specific PID gains: Kp, Ki, Kd), and commands executed.
    * Reference specific code files or functions.
* **Results:**
    * Present the quantitative and qualitative outcomes.
    * Include data plots (e.g., joint position vs. time, tracking error, end-effector path using `rqt_plot` or MATLAB).
    * Include [[RViz_Tutorial|RViz]] or [[Gazebo_Simulator|Gazebo]] screenshots/videos if applicable.
    * Note any specific observations during the experiment.
* **Analysis & Discussion:**
    * Interpret the results in light of the objective and theoretical background.
    * Did the controller perform as expected? Why or why not?
    * Discuss the effect of parameter tuning (e.g., PID gains).
    * Analyze sources of error or unexpected behavior.
    * Suggest potential improvements or next steps.

## Potential Experiment Areas

Based on common manipulator control concepts, here are some areas you might conduct experiments in:

### [[Joint Space]] Control

* **Independent Joint Control:**
    * Implement [[PID_Control]] for single or multiple joints.
    * Experiment with PID tuning methods (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols, manual tuning) and analyze step response (overshoot, rise time, settling time, steady-state error).
    * Test disturbance rejection.
    * Implement gravity compensation and evaluate its effect.
* **[[Trajectory_Planning|Joint Space Trajectory Tracking]]:**
    * Generate polynomial or spline-based joint trajectories.
    * Command the robot to follow the trajectory using a PID or other controller.
    * Measure and analyze tracking accuracy.

### [[Cartesian Space]] Control

* **Position Control:**
    * Use [[Inverse_Kinematics]] to command the end-effector to specific Cartesian poses.
    * Evaluate accuracy and repeatability.
* **Velocity Control (Resolved Motion Rate Control):**
    * Implement control using the [[Jacobian_Matrix|Jacobian]] inverse or pseudoinverse.
    * Command end-effector linear and angular velocities.
    * Observe behavior near [[Singularities]].
* **[[Trajectory_Planning|Cartesian Trajectory Tracking]]:**
    * Plan simple Cartesian paths (lines, circles).
    * Use [[MoveIt]] or implement your own controller to track the path.
    * Analyze end-effector tracking error.

### [[Dynamics]]-Based Control

* **[[Computed Torque Control]]:**
    * Implement the computed torque control law using the robot's [[Inverse_Dynamics]] model.
    * Compare tracking performance against simpler PID control.
    * Investigate sensitivity to errors in dynamic parameters.

### [[Force Control]]

* Implement impedance or admittance control (requires force sensing or estimation).
* Test hybrid position/force control for tasks involving contact (e.g., pushing against a surface).

### [[Visual Servoing]]

* Use [[Camera_Systems|camera feedback]] to control the manipulator's pose relative to a target object (Image-Based or Position-Based Visual Servoing).

### Learning-Based Control

* Use [[Reinforcement Learning (RL)|RL]] or [[Imitation Learning]] to train control policies for manipulation tasks, often starting in simulation ([[Gazebo_Simulator]]).

## Tools

Common tools used for these experiments include:
* Programming Languages: [[C++]], [[Python_for_Robotics]]
* Middleware: [[ROS (Robot Operating System)]] / [[ROS_2_Overview|ROS 2]]
* Libraries/Frameworks: [[MoveIt]], [[OMPL]], [[FCL]], [[PCL]], `ros_control`
* Simulation: [[Gazebo_Simulator]], [[MATLAB]]/Simulink
* Visualization/Debugging: [[RViz_Tutorial|RViz]], `rqt_plot`, `rqt_graph`

Documenting your experiments systematically will significantly aid your learning process and provide valuable references for future projects.
