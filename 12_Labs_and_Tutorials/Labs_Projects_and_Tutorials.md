# Labs, Projects, and Tutorials (Robotics)

## Overview

This note covers various labs, projects, and tutorials related to robotics. It includes practical examples, theoretical proofs, and key equations to help understand the fundamental concepts in robotics.

## Key Concepts

### Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. It is crucial in robotics for understanding how robots move.

**Forward Kinematics**: Determines the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint angles.

**Inverse Kinematics**: Determines the joint angles required to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector.

### Dynamics

Dynamics involves the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion. It is essential for controlling robots.

**Newton-Euler Equations**: Used to describe the motion of a rigid body under the influence of forces and torques.

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

$$
\tau = I \cdot \alpha
$$

Where:
- $F$ is the force,
- $m$ is the mass,
- $a$ is the acceleration,
- $\tau$ is the torque,
- $I$ is the moment of inertia,
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

### Control Systems

Control systems are used to manage the behavior of robots. They include feedback loops to ensure the robot performs as desired.

**PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative control is a common method used in robotics.

$$
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) \, d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$

Where:
- $u(t)$ is the control signal,
- $e(t)$ is the error,
- $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ are the proportional, integral, and derivative gains, respectively.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Forward Kinematics of a Robotic Arm

Consider a robotic arm with two joints. The forward kinematics can be described using the following transformation matrices:

$$
T_0^1 = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta_1) & -\sin(\theta_1) & 0 & a_1 \cos(\theta_1) \\
\sin(\theta_1) & \cos(\theta_1) & 0 & a_1 \sin(\theta_1) \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
T_1^2 = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta_2) & -\sin(\theta_2) & 0 & a_2 \cos(\theta_2) \\
\sin(\theta_2) & \cos(\theta_2) & 0 & a_2 \sin(\theta_2) \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The overall transformation matrix $T_0^2$ is given by:

$$
T_0^2 = T_0^1 \cdot T_1^2
$$

### Example 2: PID Control of a Robotic Joint

Consider a robotic joint with a desired angle $\theta_d$ and an actual angle $\theta$. The error $e(t)$ is given by:

$$
e(t) = \theta_d - \theta
$$

The PID control signal \( u(t) \) is calculated as:

$$
u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_0^t e(\tau) \, d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$
