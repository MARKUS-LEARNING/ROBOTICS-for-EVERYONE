# Sim2Real Experiments

**Sim2Real (Simulation-to-Reality) transfer** is a critical process in modern robotics, particularly for developing controllers using [[Machine Learning]] techniques like [[Reinforcement Learning (RL)]] or [[Imitation Learning]]. It involves training a robot's control policy or algorithm within a [[Simulation]] environment (like [[Gazebo_Simulator]]) and then successfully deploying that policy onto the physical robot hardware to perform the task in the real world.

The primary motivations for leveraging simulation are clear:
* **Speed:** Simulation runs much faster than real-time, allowing for accelerated training.
* **Cost:** Reduces wear and tear on expensive hardware and avoids costs associated with physical setup.
* **Safety:** Allows training potentially dangerous behaviors (e.g., initial exploration in RL) without risk to the robot or its surroundings.
* **Data:** Enables gathering vast amounts of training data and diverse experiences that might be impractical or impossible to collect in the real world.

However, bridging the gap between simulation and reality remains a significant challenge. This note provides a framework for documenting Sim2Real experiments.

## The Reality Gap

The core difficulty in Sim2Real transfer is the **Reality Gap**: the inherent differences between the simulated model and the physical world. Policies trained exclusively in simulation often perform poorly or fail entirely when deployed on real hardware because they implicitly learn to exploit inaccuracies or specific characteristics of the simulator that don't exist in reality.

Sources of the Reality Gap include:

* **Physics Modeling Errors:** Inaccuracies in simulating friction, contact [[Dynamics]], material properties, flexibility, actuator dynamics (backlash, delays, torque limits), etc.
* **Sensor Discrepancies:** Differences in noise models, calibration errors, field-of-view, resolution, latency, and how sensors interact with the environment (e.g., reflections for [[LIDAR]], lighting effects for [[Camera_Systems]]).
* **Visual Differences:** Mismatches in textures, lighting conditions, object appearances, clutter, and overall scene complexity.
* **Unmodeled Effects:** Phenomena present in the real world but completely absent from the simulation model.

## Common Sim2Real Transfer Techniques

Various strategies have been developed to mitigate the reality gap:

* **[[System Identification]]:** Building higher-fidelity simulation models by measuring parameters (mass, inertia, friction, sensor noise, delays) from the real robot and environment.
* **[[Domain Randomization]]:** During simulation training, intentionally randomizing various parameters (physics properties, visual textures, lighting, sensor noise, actuator delays) across a wide range. The goal is to train a policy that is robust to these variations and therefore robust to the specific mismatch between the chosen simulation parameters and reality.
* **Domain Adaptation:** Using techniques from [[Machine Learning|transfer learning]] to adapt either the simulation data, the real-world data, or the learned policy itself to reduce the domain shift (e.g., using adversarial methods like GANs to make simulated images look more realistic).
* **Robust Policy Learning/Control:** Developing [[Reinforcement Learning (RL)|RL]] algorithms or [[Control Theory|control laws]] that are inherently less sensitive to modeling errors and perturbations.
* **Real-World Fine-tuning:** Training the bulk of the policy in simulation and then performing a limited amount of additional training or fine-tuning directly on the physical robot. Requires careful setup and safety considerations.
* **Grounded Simulation / Digital Twins:** Creating simulations that are continuously updated or grounded by real-time data streamed from the physical robot, aiming for a highly accurate, dynamic virtual representation.

## Documenting Sim2Real Experiments

Building on the structure suggested in [[Manipulator_Control_Experiments]], documenting Sim2Real experiments requires specific focus on the simulation setup and the transfer process:

### Experiment: [Descriptive Title - e.g., Sim2Real Transfer of Dexterous Manipulation using Domain Randomization]

* **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
* **Objective:** State the goal, focusing on transferring a specific capability (e.g., a learned grasping policy) from simulation to a real robot and evaluating the transfer performance. Explicitly state the Sim2Real technique being tested.
* **Theoretical Background:** Link to relevant concepts ([[Reinforcement Learning (RL)]], [[Domain Randomization]], [[Simulation]], specific algorithms).
* **Setup (Simulation):**
    * Simulator: ([[Gazebo_Simulator]], Isaac Sim, MuJoCo, PyBullet, etc.).
    * Robot Model: [[URDF]]/SDF file used, kinematic/dynamic parameters.
    * Environment: Description of the simulated world, objects, sensors.
    * Physics Engine: (e.g., ODE, Bullet, DART, PhysX) and key physics parameters used.
    * Training Details: RL algorithm/framework (e.g., Stable Baselines3, TF-Agents), hyperparameters, reward function, training duration/episodes.
* **Setup (Real World):**
    * Physical Robot: Specific hardware model, controller/firmware versions.
    * Sensors: Real sensors used, calibration status.
    * Control Interface: Software used to command the real robot ([[ROS (Robot Operating System)|ROS]] nodes, custom drivers).
    * Environment: Description of the physical test setup.
* **Sim2Real Transfer Technique:**
    * Detail the specific method employed (e.g., For Domain Randomization: list parameters randomized and their ranges. For System ID: describe parameters identified and how. For Adaptation: describe the algorithm).
* **Procedure:**
    * Outline the simulation training process.
    * Describe the steps taken to deploy the trained policy onto the physical robot.
    * Detail the evaluation protocol used in *both* simulation and the real world (e.g., number of trials, success criteria, safety measures implemented for real-world tests).
* **Results:**
    * **Quantify Performance:** Provide clear metrics comparing performance in simulation vs. reality (e.g., Success Rate (Sim: 95%, Real: 70%), Average Task Completion Time (Sim: 5.2s, Real: 8.1s)).
    * **Quantify the Gap:** Analyze the difference in performance.
    * **Visualize:** Include plots, tables, [[RViz_Tutorial|RViz]] screenshots, and ideally videos comparing simulation and real-world execution.
* **Analysis & Discussion:**
    * Analyze the reasons for the observed reality gap (e.g., "Friction differences were likely the main cause of failure", "Visual appearance mismatch caused perception errors").
    * Evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen Sim2Real technique. Did it successfully bridge the gap? To what extent?
    * Discuss limitations of the experiment and potential future improvements (e.g., "Need better tactile sensing in sim", "Randomize lighting more aggressively").

Successfully bridging the Sim2Real gap is essential for making simulation a truly effective tool for developing robust, real-world robotic systems, especially as learning-based approaches become more prevalent. Documenting these experiments carefully helps track progress and understand the efficacy of different transfer techniques.
