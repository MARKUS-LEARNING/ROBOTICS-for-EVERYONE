# Autonomous Navigation

**Autonomous Navigation** enables robots to move independently within their environment, utilizing sensors, algorithms, and control systems to plan and execute paths safely and efficiently. It is a critical capability for robots operating in dynamic and unstructured environments, allowing them to perform tasks without human intervention. Autonomous navigation involves various components, including mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance, all of which work together to ensure reliable and safe movement.

## Key Concepts in Autonomous Navigation

1. **Mapping**: The process of creating a representation of the environment, which is essential for understanding the spatial context and planning paths. Maps can be metric, topological, or feature-based, depending on the application and requirements.

2. **Localization**: The determination of the robot's position and orientation within the environment. Accurate localization is crucial for effective navigation and interaction with the surroundings.

3. **Path Planning**: The process of determining a collision-free path from the robot's current location to its destination. Path planning algorithms consider the environment's constraints and the robot's capabilities to generate efficient and safe paths.

4. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The ability to detect and avoid obstacles in the environment, ensuring safe navigation. Obstacle avoidance algorithms use sensor data to identify obstacles and adjust the robot's path accordingly.

5. **Sensor Fusion**: The integration of data from multiple sensors to improve the accuracy and reliability of navigation. Sensor fusion combines information from various sources, such as lidar, cameras, and GPS, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the environment.

6. **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: A technique that allows a robot to build a map of its environment while simultaneously determining its location within that map. SLAM is essential for autonomous navigation in unknown or dynamic environments.

## Key Equations

- **Path Planning Cost Function**:

  $$
  C(p) = \int_{0}^{T} L(p(t), \dot{p}(t), \ddot{p}(t)) \, dt
  $$

  <br>

  where $C(p)$ is the cost of the path $p$, $L$ is the Lagrangian that defines the cost based on the path's position $p(t)$, velocity $\dot{p}(t)$, and acceleration $\ddot{p}(t)$. This equation is used to evaluate the efficiency and safety of a planned path.

  <br>

- **Obstacle Avoidance Potential Field**:

  $$
  U_{\text{rep}}(q) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{2} \eta \left( \frac{1}{\rho(q)} - \frac{1}{\rho_0} \right)^2 & \text{if } \rho(q) \leq \rho_0 \\
  0 & \text{if } \rho(q) > \rho_0
  \end{cases}
  $$

  <br>

  where $U_{\text{rep}}(q)$ is the repulsive potential field, $\rho(q)$ is the distance to the nearest obstacle, $\rho_0$ is the influence distance, and $\eta$ is a scaling factor. This equation is used to create a repulsive force that helps the robot avoid obstacles.

  <br>

- **Kalman Filter State Update**:

  $$
  \hat{x}_t = \hat{x}_{t-1} + K_t (z_t - H \hat{x}_{t-1})
  $$

  <br>

  where $\hat{x}_t$ is the estimated state at time $t$, $K_t$ is the Kalman gain, $z_t$ is the measurement, $H$ is the observation model, and $\hat{x}_{t-1}$ is the previous state estimate. This equation updates the state estimate based on new measurements, improving localization accuracy.
