# Adaptive Control

**Adaptive Control** is a control strategy used in robotics to handle uncertainties and variations in system dynamics. It enables robust and flexible control of robotic systems by adjusting control parameters in real-time based on the system's performance and environmental changes. Adaptive control is essential for applications where the system's dynamics are not fully known or change over time, ensuring accurate and stable operation.

## Key Concepts

### System Identification

System identification involves determining the mathematical model of a system from observed input-output data. In adaptive control, system identification is used to estimate the parameters of the system's dynamic model, which are then used to adjust the control strategy.

### Parameter Adaptation

Parameter adaptation involves adjusting the control parameters based on the system's performance and changes in its dynamics. This allows the control system to adapt to uncertainties and variations, maintaining optimal performance.

### Control Algorithms

Adaptive control uses algorithms that can modify their behavior based on the system's response. These algorithms include techniques such as model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and self-tuning regulators (STR).

### Robustness

Robustness refers to the ability of a control system to maintain performance and stability in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. Adaptive control enhances the robustness of robotic systems by continuously adjusting to changes.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)

MRAC is an adaptive control technique where the desired performance is specified by a reference model. The control law is adjusted to minimize the error between the reference model's output and the system's output. The adaptation law for MRAC can be represented as:

$$
\dot{\theta} = -\Gamma e \frac{\partial e}{\partial \theta}
$$

where:
- $\theta$ is the vector of adjustable parameters.
- $\Gamma$ is the adaptation gain matrix.
- $e$ is the error between the reference model's output and the system's output.

### Self-Tuning Regulator (STR)

STR is an adaptive control technique where the controller parameters are adjusted based on the estimated parameters of the system's model. The control law for STR can be represented as:

$$
u(t) = K(t) r(t)
$$

where:
- $u(t)$ is the control input.
- $K(t)$ is the vector of controller parameters.
- $r(t)$ is the vector of system states and reference inputs.

### Example: Robotic Manipulator

Consider a robotic manipulator with uncertain dynamics. Adaptive control is used to adjust the control parameters based on the manipulator's performance and changes in its dynamics. The adaptation law adjusts the parameters to minimize the error between the desired trajectory and the actual trajectory, ensuring precise and stable control.

## Applications in Robotics

- **Manipulation**: Adaptive control is used to achieve precise and dynamic control of robotic manipulators, enabling tasks such as assembly, welding, and material handling in the presence of uncertainties.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Enhances the control of autonomous robots, allowing them to navigate and interact with their environment accurately despite variations and disturbances.
- **Trajectory Tracking**: Ensures that robotic systems follow planned trajectories accurately, improving the performance and reliability of tasks.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adaptive control can be combined with learning algorithms to handle uncertainties and variations in the system's dynamics, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation.
