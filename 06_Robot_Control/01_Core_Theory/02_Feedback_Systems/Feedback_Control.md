# PID Control in Robotic Arms

This note discusses the implementation of PID control in robotic arms for precise movement and stability.



# Feedback Control

**Feedback Control** is a system that uses the output of a process to adjust its input, ensuring stability and accuracy in robotic systems. It is a fundamental concept in control theory and is widely used in robotics to manage and regulate motion, position, and other dynamic behaviors. Feedback control systems are essential for achieving precise and reliable performance in automated systems.

## Types of Feedback Control

1. **Negative Feedback**:
   - The most common type, where the feedback signal is subtracted from the input to reduce the error.
   - Used to stabilize systems and minimize deviations from the desired state.

2. **Positive Feedback**:
   - The feedback signal is added to the input, which can lead to instability if not properly managed.
   - Less common in control systems but used in specific applications like oscillators.

3. **Proportional Control (P)**:
   - Adjusts the control signal proportionally to the error between the desired and actual output.
   - Simple but can lead to steady-state errors.

4. **Integral Control (I)**:
   - Integrates the error over time to eliminate steady-state errors.
   - Can introduce oscillations if not tuned properly.

5. **Derivative Control (D)**:
   - Uses the rate of change of the error to anticipate future behavior.
   - Helps to dampen oscillations and improve stability.

6. **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control**:
   - Combines proportional, integral, and derivative control to provide robust and adaptive control.
   - Widely used due to its effectiveness and flexibility.

## Key Equations

- **Proportional Control**:
  $$
  u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t)
  $$
  where $u(t)$ is the control signal, $K_p$ is the proportional gain, and $e(t)$ is the error between the desired and actual output.
  <br></br>

- **Integral Control**:
  $$
  u(t) = K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) \, d\tau
  $$
  where $K_i$ is the integral gain, and $e(\tau)$ is the error over time.
  <br></br>

- **Derivative Control**:
  $$
  u(t) = K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
  $$
  where $K_d$ is the derivative gain.
  <br></br>

- **PID Control**:
  $$
  u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) \, d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
  $$
  Combines proportional, integral, and derivative control for comprehensive feedback.
