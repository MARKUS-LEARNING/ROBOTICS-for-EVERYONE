# Key Figures and Labs in Robotics History

The development of robotics has been driven by the contributions of numerous visionary individuals and pioneering research institutions. This note highlights some of the key figures and laboratories that have played significant roles in shaping the field.

## Key Figures

### Conceptual & Literary Foundations

* **Karel Čapek (1890-1938):** Czech playwright who introduced the word "robot" (from "robota," meaning forced labor) in his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).
* **[[Isaac Asimov]] (1920-1992):** Influential science fiction author who coined the term "robotics" and formulated the famous Three Laws of Robotics, profoundly shaping ethical discussions around robots.

### Industrial Robotics Pioneers

* **[[George Devol]] (1912-2011):** Inventor who patented the "Programmed Article Transfer" (1954), the basis for the first industrial robot. Co-founded Unimation.
* **[[Joseph Engelberger]] (1925-2015):** Widely considered the "Father of Robotics". Co-founded Unimation with Devol and successfully commercialized the [[Unimate]] robot, installing the first one at General Motors in 1961.
* **[[Victor Scheinman]] (1942-2016):** Designed the influential electric [[Stanford Arm]] (1969) while at Stanford. Later founded Vicarm Inc. and designed the [[PUMA]] (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly) robot for Unimation.
* **Hiroshi Makino (1935-2014):** Professor at Yamanashi University, Japan, who led the development of the [[SCARA]] (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot concept in the late 1970s, revolutionizing automated assembly.
* **Reymond Clavel (b. 1950):** Inventor of the parallel kinematic [[Delta Robot]] at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in the 1980s, enabling high-speed pick-and-place operations.

### AI and Research Pioneers (Selected Examples)

* **John McCarthy (1927-2011):** Coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" (1956). Pioneer in AI research at Dartmouth, MIT, and later [[Stanford AI Lab|Stanford AI Lab (SAIL)]].
* **Marvin Minsky (1927-2016):** Co-founder of the [[MIT CSAIL|MIT AI Lab]]. Major figure in AI, neural networks, cognitive science, and early robotics research.
* **Heinrich Ernst:** Developed one of the earliest computer-controlled manipulators with tactile sensing (MH-1) for his MIT PhD thesis in 1961.
* **Charles Rosen (1917-2002):** Led the team at SRI International that developed [[Shakey]], the first integrated AI mobile robot (1966-1972).
* **Rodney Brooks (b. 1954):** Proponent of behavior-based robotics (Subsumption Architecture). Former director of [[MIT CSAIL|MIT AI Lab/CSAIL]], co-founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics.
* **Marc Raibert (b. 1949):** Founder of Boston Dynamics and pioneer in dynamic legged locomotion, initially at the MIT Leg Lab.
* **[[Masahiro Mori]] (b. 1927):** Japanese roboticist who proposed the [[Uncanny Valley]] hypothesis concerning human emotional response to robot appearance (1970).
* **Oussama Khatib (b. 1950):** Professor at Stanford University. Major contributions to robot control (Operational Space Formulation), [[Humanoid_Robots|humanoid robotics]], haptics, and human-centered robotics.
* **Sebastian Thrun (b. 1967):** Leading researcher in probabilistic robotics, [[SLAM]], and autonomous vehicles. Led Stanford's winning DARPA Grand Challenge team (Stanley). Co-founder of Google X and Udacity. Formerly faculty at CMU and Stanford.
* **Takeo Kanade (b. 1945):** Leading researcher in computer vision and robotics at [[CMU Robotics Institute|CMU's Robotics Institute]].
* **Red Whittaker (b. 1948):** Pioneer in field robotics, particularly for hazardous environments (e.g., Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) and autonomous vehicles (NavLab series) at [[CMU Robotics Institute|CMU's Robotics Institute]].

*(This list is representative, not exhaustive; many other individuals have made critical contributions.)*
