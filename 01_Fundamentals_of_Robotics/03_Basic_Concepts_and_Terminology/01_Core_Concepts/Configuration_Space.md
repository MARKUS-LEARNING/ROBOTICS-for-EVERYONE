# Configuration Space

**Configuration Space** is a mathematical representation of all possible configurations a robotic system can assume. It is essential for motion planning and control in robotics, as it provides a framework for analyzing the feasible configurations of a robot and planning its movements within an environment. The configuration space includes all the possible positions and orientations of the robot's components, such as joint angles and end-effector positions.

## Key Concepts

### Configuration

A configuration of a robotic system refers to a specific arrangement of its components, typically described by a set of parameters such as joint angles or positions. The configuration space encompasses all possible configurations the system can achieve.

### Degrees of Freedom

Degrees of freedom (DoF) represent the number of independent parameters required to define the configuration of a robotic system. The configuration space is defined by these degrees of freedom, which determine the system's ability to move and interact with its environment.

### Workspace

The workspace is the physical space within which a robotic system can operate. It is a projection of the configuration space into the Cartesian space, representing the reachable positions and orientations of the robot's end-effector or other critical points.

### Obstacle Space

The obstacle space represents the regions within the configuration space that are occupied by obstacles. Identifying and avoiding these regions is crucial for safe and efficient motion planning.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Configuration Representation

The configuration of a robotic system with $n$ degrees of freedom can be represented as a vector in the configuration space:

$$
\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} q_1 \\ q_2 \\ \vdots \\ q_n \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $q_i$ represents the $i$-th degree of freedom, such as a joint angle or position.

### Configuration Space

The configuration space $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of all possible configurations $\mathbf{q}$:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \{ \mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \text{subject to constraints} \}
$$

### Workspace Mapping

The mapping from the configuration space to the workspace is given by the forward kinematics function $f(\mathbf{q})$:

$$
\mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{q})
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the position and orientation of the end-effector or another point of interest in the workspace.

### Example: Robotic Arm

Consider a robotic arm with three revolute joints. The configuration space is defined by the joint angles $\mathbf{q} = [q_1, q_2, q_3]^T$. The workspace is the set of all reachable positions and orientations of the end-effector, calculated using the forward kinematics:

$$
\mathbf{x} = f(\mathbf{q})
$$

For motion planning, the configuration space is analyzed to find a collision-free path from an initial configuration $\mathbf{q}_{\text{init}}$ to a goal configuration $\mathbf{q}_{\text{goal}}$.

## Applications in Robotics

- **Motion Planning**: Configuration space is used to plan collision-free paths for robotic systems, ensuring they can navigate their environment safely and efficiently.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: By identifying and avoiding obstacle regions in the configuration space, robots can operate in cluttered environments without collisions.
- **Manipulation**: Understanding the configuration space allows for precise control of robotic manipulators, enabling them to reach and manipulate objects within their workspace.
- **Path Planning**: Configuration space analysis is crucial for planning optimal paths for mobile robots and other systems, considering constraints and obstacles.
