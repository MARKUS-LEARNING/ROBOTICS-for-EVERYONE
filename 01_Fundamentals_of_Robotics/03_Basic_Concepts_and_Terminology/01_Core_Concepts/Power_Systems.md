# Power Systems

**Power Systems** encompass the technologies and components used to generate, store, convert, and distribute electrical power in robotic systems, ensuring efficient and reliable operation. These systems are crucial for enabling robots to perform tasks autonomously, especially in mobile and remote applications where access to external power sources is limited. Effective power management is essential for optimizing the performance and longevity of robotic systems.

## Mathematical Representations

### Battery Capacity

The capacity of a battery is typically expressed in ampere-hours ($Ah$) and can be related to the energy stored ($E$) using the battery voltage ($V$):

$$
E = V \cdot Q
$$

where $Q$ is the battery capacity in ampere-hours.

### Power Conversion Efficiency

The efficiency ($\eta$) of a power conversion system is given by the ratio of the output power ($P_{out}$) to the input power ($P_{in}$):

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}
$$

### Energy Harvesting

The power ($P$) harvested from a solar panel can be calculated using the solar irradiance ($I$), the panel area ($A$), and the efficiency ($\eta$):

$$
P = I \cdot A \cdot \eta
$$
