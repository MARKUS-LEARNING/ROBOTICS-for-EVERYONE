# Mechatronics

**Mechatronics** is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electronics, computer engineering, and control engineering to design and create intelligent systems and products. It focuses on integrating mechanical systems with electronics and control systems to develop automated and smart devices. Mechatronics is essential in the development of modern robotic systems, enabling the creation of devices that can sense, process, and respond to their environment.

## Key Concepts in Mechatronics

1. **Integration of Disciplines**: Mechatronics involves the integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering principles to create cohesive and functional systems.

2. **Sensors and Actuators**: The use of sensors to gather data from the environment and actuators to produce movement or control in response to that data.

3. **Control Systems**: The development of control algorithms and systems to govern the behavior of mechatronic systems, ensuring they operate as intended.

4. **Embedded Systems**: The design of embedded systems that combine hardware and software to perform specific functions within a larger system.

5. **Automation and Robotics**: The application of mechatronics in the development of automated systems and robots, which can perform tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention.

## Key Equations

- **Control System Dynamics**:

$$
\tau = J^T \cdot F
$$
  
  where $\tau$ is the torque applied by the actuators, $J$ is the Jacobian matrix that relates joint velocities to end-effector velocities, and $F$ is the force exerted by the end-effector.
  <br></br>

- **Sensor Fusion**:

$$
\hat{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
$$

  where $\hat{x}$ is the fused estimate, $x_i$ are the individual sensor measurements, and $w_i$ are the weights assigned to each sensor based on their reliability or accuracy.
  <br></br>

- **PID Control**:

$$
u(t) = K_p \cdot e(t) + K_i \cdot \int e(t) \, dt + K_d \cdot \frac{de(t)}{dt}
$$

  where $u(t)$ is the control input, $K_p$ is the proportional gain, $e(t)$ is the error, $K_i$ is the integral gain, and $K_d$ is the derivative gain.
