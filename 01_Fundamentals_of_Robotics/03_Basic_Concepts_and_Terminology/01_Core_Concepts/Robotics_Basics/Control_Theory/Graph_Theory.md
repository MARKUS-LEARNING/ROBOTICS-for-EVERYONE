# Graph Theory

**Graph Theory** is a branch of mathematics that studies graph structures, which are mathematical models of pairwise relations between objects. It provides a framework for analyzing complex networks and systems, making it a fundamental tool in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and social sciences. Graph theory is used to model and solve problems involving connectivity, paths, flows, and optimization.

## Key Concepts

1. **Graph**: A structure consisting of a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges (or links) that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent relationships and interactions between entities.
   <br>

2. **Vertex (Node)**: A fundamental unit of a graph representing an object or an entity. Vertices are the basic elements that form the structure of a graph.
   <br>

3. **Edge (Link)**: A connection between two vertices, representing a relationship or interaction between them. Edges can be directed or undirected and may have weights.
   <br>

4. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: A graph in which edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices. Directed graphs are used to model systems with unidirectional flows or influences.
   <br>

5. **Undirected Graph**: A graph in which edges do not have a direction, representing mutual relationships between vertices. Undirected graphs are commonly used to model bidirectional interactions.
   <br>

6. **Weighted Graph**: A graph where each edge has an associated weight, representing a cost or value associated with the connection. Weighted graphs are essential for problems involving optimization and resource allocation.
   <br>

7. **Path**: A sequence of vertices and edges that connects a starting vertex to an ending vertex. Paths are fundamental in routing, navigation, and connectivity analysis.
   <br>

8. **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex and does not repeat any other vertices. Cycles are important in detecting loops and redundancies in networks.
   <br>

9. **Connected Graph**: A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices. Connected graphs are used to analyze the overall connectivity of a network.
   <br>

10. **Tree**: A connected graph with no cycles, often used to represent hierarchical structures. Trees are fundamental in algorithms for sorting, searching, and organizing data.

## Mathematical Representations

Graph theory involves several mathematical representations and notations:

- **Adjacency Matrix**: A matrix representation of a graph where the element at row $i$ and column $j$ is 1 if there is an edge between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$, and 0 otherwise. The adjacency matrix $A$ for a graph with $n$ vertices is defined as:

$$
A_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if there is an edge between vertex } i \text{ and vertex } j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
<br>

- **Incidence Matrix**: A matrix representation of a graph where the rows correspond to vertices and the columns correspond to edges, with entries indicating the incidence of vertices with edges. The incidence matrix $B$ for a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is defined as:

$$
B_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if vertex } i \text{ is incident to edge } j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
<br>

- **Degree of a Vertex**: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For a vertex $v$, the degree is denoted as $\deg(v)$ and is calculated as:

$$
\deg(v) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{vi}
$$

where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the graph.
<br>

- **Graph Coloring**: An assignment of colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Graph coloring is used in scheduling and resource allocation problems to minimize conflicts.

## Applications of Graph Theory

Graph theory has a wide range of applications across various fields:

- **Computer Science**: Used in algorithm design, network analysis, and data structures. Examples include shortest path algorithms, network flow problems, and graph traversal techniques.
  <br>

- **Engineering**: Applied in circuit design, communication networks, and transportation systems to optimize connectivity and efficiency.
  <br>

- **Social Sciences**: Used to model social networks, analyze relationships, and study the spread of information or diseases.
  <br>

- **Operations Research**: Employed in optimization problems, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and supply chain management.
  <br>

- **Biology**: Used to model biological networks, such as metabolic pathways and genetic interactions.
