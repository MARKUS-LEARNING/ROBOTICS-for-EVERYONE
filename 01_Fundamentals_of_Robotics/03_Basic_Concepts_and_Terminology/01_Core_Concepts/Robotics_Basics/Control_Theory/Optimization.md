# Optimization

**Optimization** is the process of finding the best solution from all feasible solutions, often involving mathematical techniques to maximize or minimize an objective function subject to constraints. It is widely used in various fields such as engineering, economics, and computer science to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance performance.

## Key Components of Optimization

1. **Objective Function**: A mathematical function that defines the quantity to be maximized or minimized, representing the goal of the optimization problem.
   <br>

2. **Constraints**: Limitations or restrictions that define the feasible region within which the solution must lie.
   <br>

3. **Decision Variables**: Variables that can be controlled or changed to find the optimal solution.
   <br>

4. **Feasibility Analysis**: The process of determining whether a solution satisfies all the constraints of the problem.
   <br>

5. **Optimization Techniques**: Methods and algorithms used to find the optimal solution, such as linear programming, nonlinear programming, and gradient descent.
   <br>

6. **Computational Mathematics**: The use of mathematical models and algorithms to solve optimization problems efficiently.
   <br>

## Mathematical Representations

### Linear Programming

Linear programming is a method to achieve the best outcome in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. The standard form of a linear programming problem is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Maximize } & c^T x \\
\text{Subject to } & A x \leq b \\
& x \geq 0
\end{align*}
$$

where $c$ is the cost vector, $x$ is the decision variable vector, $A$ is the constraint matrix, and $b$ is the resource vector.

<br>

### Nonlinear Programming

Nonlinear programming involves the optimization of a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear constraints. The general form is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Minimize } & f(x) \\
\text{Subject to } & g_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, m \\
& h_j(x) = 0, \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots, p
\end{align*}
$$

where $f(x)$ is the objective function, $g_i(x)$ are inequality constraints, and $h_j(x)$ are equality constraints.

<br>

### Gradient Descent

Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. The update rule for gradient descent is:

$$
x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k)
$$

where $x_k$ is the current solution, $\alpha$ is the step size (learning rate), and $\nabla f(x_k)$ is the gradient of the objective function at $x_k$.
