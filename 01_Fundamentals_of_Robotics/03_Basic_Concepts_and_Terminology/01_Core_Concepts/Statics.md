# Statics

**Statics** is the branch of mechanics that deals with the analysis of forces and moments on bodies at rest. It focuses on understanding how forces and moments interact to maintain equilibrium in physical systems. Statics is fundamental in engineering and physics, providing the basis for analyzing the stability and balance of structures, machines, and other mechanical systems.

## Key Concepts in Statics

1. **Equilibrium**: The state of a body where the net force and net moment acting on it are zero, resulting in no acceleration. Equilibrium is a central concept in statics, as it describes the conditions under which a body remains at rest.
   <br>

2. **Free Body Diagram**: A diagram that represents a body isolated from its environment, showing all the external forces and moments acting on it. Free body diagrams are essential tools in statics for visualizing and analyzing the forces and moments on a body.
   <br>

3. **Force Analysis**: The process of determining the magnitudes and directions of forces acting on a body. Force analysis involves resolving forces into components and using equilibrium equations to solve for unknown forces.
   <br>

4. **Moment Analysis**: The process of determining the moments (or torques) acting on a body and their effects on the body's rotational equilibrium. Moment analysis involves calculating the moments about a point or axis and using equilibrium conditions to solve for unknown moments.
   <br>

5. **Resultant Force**: The single force that has the same effect as a system of forces acting on a body. The resultant force is the vector sum of all the forces acting on the body.
   <br>

6. **Center of Gravity**: The point at which the weight of a body is considered to be concentrated. The center of gravity is the point where the resultant force of gravity acts on the body.

## Key Equations

### Equilibrium Conditions

The conditions for equilibrium require that the sum of forces and moments in each direction must be zero:

$$
\sum F_x = 0, \quad \sum F_y = 0, \quad \sum F_z = 0
$$

$$
\sum M_x = 0, \quad \sum M_y = 0, \quad \sum M_z = 0
$$

### Resultant Force

The resultant force $F_R$ is calculated as the vector sum of the components of the forces acting on the body:

$$
F_R = \sqrt{F_x^2 + F_y^2 + F_z^2}
$$

### Moment About a Point

The moment $M$ of a force about a point is given by:

$$
M = r \times F
$$

where $r$ is the position vector from the point to the line of action of the force, and $F$ is the force vector.

### Center of Gravity

The coordinates of the center of gravity $(x_{\text{cg}}, y_{\text{cg}}, z_{\text{cg}})$ are calculated as:

$$
x_{\text{cg}} = \frac{\sum m_i x_i}{\sum m_i}, \quad y_{\text{cg}} = \frac{\sum m_i y_i}{\sum m_i}, \quad z_{\text{cg}} = \frac{\sum m_i z_i}{\sum m_i}
$$

where $m_i$ are the masses of the individual parts of the body, and $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ are the coordinates of the centers of mass of the individual parts.
